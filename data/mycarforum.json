The OT quoted for my car is somewhat similar to other rivals. Wonder if the OT amount varies according to which model you purchase?\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Can share how you do it?\n\u00a0\nI meant that I clean the engine compartment of my FD, and I will do the same when my new ride comes.\nHow to clean the compartment?\n\u00a0\nAs others mentioned:\n- blower\n- engine shampoo\n- be careful to do it only when it's cool, and wipe dry the compartment\n\u00a0\nYou can also go for a car shampoo, and they also do it, eg Kah Motor has a package, polish the car, clean and polish the interior and shampoo the engine area. I do it every Jan before CNY. The car smells nice and my family loves it. Worth the 300 plus.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOh, how do does keeping the wheels and engine clean improve performance, you may ask? Well the car functions better, I always feel that to keep the running bits clean is more essential than just the exterior. Of course cleaning the exterior reduces drag too..\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited October 13, 2016 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

These engines, no matter how impressive they may sound, are not concepts, and will make debuts in production cars in 2017.\nThere\u2019s love for both petrol and diesel engines from Mercedes-Benz, ranging from four-cylinder motors all the way to big V8s, although the latter does see some further shrinkage in terms of displacement. All engines are built around the 500cc per cylinder displacement concept so you have 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 litre engines.\nNew M256 inline-six petrol engine\n\nThe rumours are true \u2013 Mercedes-Benz has abandoned the V6 in favour for the inline-6 configuration. But the inline-six layout isn\u2019t all that\u2019s new for the 3.0 litre M256 petrol engine.\nThe engine uses a 48V electrical system, which allows the entire ancillary system to be overhauled. For example, there is no longer any belt drive in front of the engine to power stuff like the water pump or aircond compressor \u2013 these are all electric items that are powered by the 48V system now, so they can be positioned elsewhere in the engine bay.\nThis results in shorter installation space requirements. Since the inline-six is narrower than V6, the ancillary systems are positioned on the left and right of the engine.\nThe engine is turbocharged but also has a 48V-powered electric auxiliary compressor (eZV, or electric turbo) to eliminate turbo lag. The starter motor has also been replaced with an Integrated Starter-Generator (ISG) installed in between the engine and the transmission that can provide a 15 kW boost to the engine.\nTotal output for the engine can go up to over 408 horsepower and over 500 Nm, while CO2 emissions have reduced by about 15 percent compared to the outgoing V6 engine.\nThe engine also includes a particulate filter in the exhaust system, which is something you usually see only on diesel engines. For petrol engine particulate filters, Mercedes-Benz is using cordierite, instead of silicon carbide which it uses for diesel particulate filters.\nThis engine will debut with the W222 S-Class facelift next year.\nNew OM656 inline-six diesel engine\n\nLovers of big diesel engines will be able to enjoy more power \u2013 the OM656 is now expected to do 313 horsepower up from 258 horsepower of the outgoing big diesel, while consumption is reduced by seven percent.\nThe OM656 uses stepped-bowl combustion, two-stage exhaust turbocharging, and a new feature for Mercedes-Benz diesel engines \u2013 CAMTRONIC variable valve timing.\nNew M176 V8 bi-turbo petrol engine\n\nAs expected, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s non-AMG V8 is now 4.0 litres, following the direction set by AMG\u2019s new V8 engine. From its 3,982cc displacement, peak horsepower is 476 hp (up from 455 hp) with peak torque of 700 Nm kicking in from 2,000 rpm.\nThe closed deck V8 has cylinder deactivation, which allows it to run on four cylinders during light loads and engine speeds of up to 3,250 rpm via the CAMTRONIC variable valve timing system. It uses a particulate filter as well.\nThis new engine will debut in the W222 S-Class facelift.\nNew M264 four-cylinder petrol engine\n\nMost Malaysians will be buying 200 and 250 badged Mercedes-Benz cars, so this should be the most interesting bit to read about. Like the M256 six-pot, the new four-cylinder engine gets a 48V system. The turbochargers are now twin-scroll turbos, and there\u2019s a particulate filter in the exhaust system.\nHowever, instead of an ISG sandwiched in the gearbox, the M264 uses a belt-driven 48V starter-alternator (BSA) mounted where the conventional alternator usually sits. Mercedes-Benz says the BSA will allow improvements to the engine\u2019s auto idle stop/start operation, electric boost at engine speeds of up to 2,500 rpm, energy recovery up to 12.5 kW and coasting with the engine turned off.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

GLA is not a big car, wont be comfortable for 5pax. back side quite upright so not very comfortable for long distance. for the price range of 160k for GLA, i believe you can get more spacious car especially when u said 5-6 pac shouldnt it be mpv instead. i think you can get odessy top end for the same price.\nbuying GLA honestly is for the badge.maybe you can consider the bmw 218GT diesel compact mpv. heard quite good review.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The GLA is like an A class that sits higher. \nIt's stylish but not that roomy. \nFor more room the B180 is actually bigger inside. Otherwise the KIA carens is a BMW lookalike for a lot less and drives pretty well. \nSee how often you need six seats. If it's a must then the BMW will be a better bet. \nOtherwise the C class will possible sit five. \nIf the mpv looks don't get you don't, the B200 is a nice car. \nFurthermore the FC of the B class or even the BMW is a lot better. \nYou will get used to the stalk but again if that matters the BMW is more conventional. \nAsk yourself a hard question as to why the CLA - brand, style or a need?\nIf I had your budget and need to move more people I will consider the BMW 218GT or a second hand petrol version if diesel worries you. \nBut do test drive the B200 and squeeze them during the coming motor show :)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

And my links to servicing costs at Merc. \nIf you must have reliability and cheap service maybe the honda jade or Kia carens might give you less to worry. \nI like the B180 because it's easy to drive, very safe and easy for my mum to get into. Enough power for me. Remember it drives in a more stately fashion so you don't feel or hear the roar. \nIt's definitely faster than the lander but so are a lot of cars. \nIt sounds like you need a people mover more than a SUV. \nYou can also see the Forester for real pickup and Japan origin. \nThe Opel Astra Tourer and Zafira are not bad too. \nUltimately the Conti cars give a different feel. And costs. \nSo YMMV\nBut do a test drive of both BMW and Kia then try the B200. \nAsk the reps for the list of service costs as well. \n\u00a0\nDecide with both your wallet and heart. But don't buy a car for the badge only ya.. \nIMO the BMW is good but for 30k less there's the Kia if you need seven seats. \nFor shiok feel the Conti cars are in a different class but you pay bro ;)\nBtw Merc and BMW give higher over trades but it's all part of their business model.

But for future maybe i have to bring my Father in law to Hospital on regular basis, hence thinking to upgrade.\n\u00a0\n@Heman75, Sorry i am driving Lancer glx (don't laugh ). And it is around 8 and half year old ride (my first ride ). Although my glx is stock but when i test drive Merc it was not able to pick as my glx picks, maybe its only me but once i put feet to paddle in glx i could feel car pick up speed but i didn't feel same pick in merc (or maybe it did and i didn't felt it, yesterday it was getting dark and raining\nsame time) but the representative was telling me it is adaptive (maybe it will adapt to my style ).\n\u00a0\n@therock, May be Badge (just want to experience continental also) . My father in law used to drive taxi and he keep telling me\nDiesel would have problem (as i never drive diesel before so just trying to ask bros who have wisdom of driving daily). I am driving\nJapanese car from last 8+ years and touch wood i never had a problem once, i just bring my car for regular service from c&c and never\nworried about repairs. The few things which are bothering me a bit\n1- How frequent there is break down in continental cars?\n2- What is frequency of servicing and how much does it cost (my current ride i pay around 1.2k/year for servicing \"c&c charge\").\n3- Cost of Petrol/diesel (i stay in town and my ride will be used to fetch and drop family members, all destinations are very near around 10-25 min drive). For now i fill tank 4-5 times a month which cost me around 60$ per fill and last around 300KM (not fantastic FC but cannot complain for glx).\n\u00a0\nMaybe some bros will think if so close distance why not use public transport \u00a0 (due to medical reasons, i need ride for my kids and my\nfather in law).\n\u00a0\nAlso i need to trade my current ride and got very different quotes.\n\u00a0\nHonda gave me quote of 12k, BMW 15k and Merc 23k.\nTrying to stick with Japanese or Continential (don't know why i don't have good immersion of Korean rides).\nI hope i didn't went to off topic .\n\u00a0\nRegards,\n\u00a0\nLEE.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nwith regards to breaking down... have the c class w204 for about 5 years now... zero.\nusual wear/tear like suspension and mounting (changed at 3rd yr on warranty), tyres, and light bulbs...\u00a0\nand ya.. even the headlinght light bulb i just change only.. the rest are still going strong.\n\u00a0\nunless of course.. kenna a lemon i got nothing to say.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Really appreciate all advice!\n\u00a0\nBro,\nMerc and some other premium brands have a more unique overtrade policy.\nIt makes their cars cheaper and more attractive, giving a certain illusion of a huge discount.\nYou need to talk to a sale agent and see the actual deal.\nTypically, if you have a car for scrapping, they can offer you a very nice price for it, that is 10-20k more than the scrap value. This is their deal, and the quantum depends on your car and the promotion at hand.\nEg last year, they had some deals for the C class and other models, so talk to someone there.\nIf you don't have anyone, I can pm you mine.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLook up the typical freebies, I listed earlier in this thread, cheers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Soon a SE was \"assign\" to assist me.When approached by the SE, he ask which car im interested in\u00a0so i told him its the C class coupe and would like to have a test drive.So he immediately ask for my driver licence and walk away to prepare the car.Although I did not ask, he did not brief or show me around the c class coupe, as im not familiar with the equipment or tech that is in it.(example like: kick to open boot, auto parking feature, and the audio 20)\n\u00a0\nAfter 10mins he arrive with the car and we hop into it.Upon getting into the car, he did not explain to me the controls until i asked him to. Not everyone drives a mercedes right?So\u00a0I was\u00a0briefed for less than\u00a0a min like how to shift gears and\u00a0the signal lights..... that's all.. and off I go.The coupe sits really low and i love it. I test drove the C180 coupe and it feels punchy in the sports+ mode.They don't have the C200 version for me to try it out (omg really C&C??). Requested for C200 sedan but was out for servicing.The suspension is soft and good. Not sure about the sports suspension in AMG line as they only have ONE test drive car.\nWhile inside the car i ask about the difference between the C180 vs C200.SE said: \"Oh.. only the engine is bigger...\"i said: \"All of that for 25k difference?\"SE said: \"Yes\"i said: \"i thought the leathery is different?\"SE said: \"hmm... ah yes.. the leather is abit different...\"i said: \"How about the dash and upper door trims? They look cheap for a almost $200k car, can i pay additional for it to be upholstered\"SE said: \"Nope there isn't any.\"i said: \"Why not?\"SE said: \"All models comes in as standard and we do not have this option.\"i siad: \"Even the C200 and C300?\"SE said: \"Yes.\"(We did talk more in details but these are the gist of it)\n\u00a0\nI was pretty sure i've read it before somewhere regarding C180 vs C200\u00a0and here are the difference:1. LED intelligent Light System.2. Leather upholstery3. Exhaust system with two visible tailpipe trim (not sure what it this... can some one verify?)\n\u00a0\nI've found out that someone\u00a0had paid and gotten their car's dash & upper door panel upholstered. Its a new C class coupe too.http://www.sgmerc.com/topic/21318-2016-mercedes-c-class-coupe/\n\n\nMy conclusion is that the SE is pretty unprepared and unaware of their own products.\nSo the experience was pretty turned off. After the ride, we sit down, no drinks were offered.He eventually did not even quote me a price\u00a0as he said because the COE recently release so he can't provide a proper quote.He did not mention that will get back to me if it does.What he actually does:1. Tell me my current car trade in value. (its pretty low compared to its competitors, up to 7k)2. Current 3k OT and 3K service.\nHe did not mention of any freebies or existing on running promotion where there actually\u00a0is (early bird promotion for certain models).One of my sibling was there and actually interested in one of the promotional models but he held back and didn't mention until i spoke of the promotion title.\n\u00a0\nSo i left the place without knowing much about the car, as he seems \"busy\" and really wish end this quickly.He did not provide any details regarding any good feature that will entice a customer to buy. Nowadays Mercedes cars sells their own right?He told me buying this car now is almost like a\u00a0\"risk\"\u00a0as C&C will not lock any prices even you paid a down payment.If COE went up, you paid the balance, there is no other way unless you forfeit the down payment.Reason being their waiting time is 6 months.(Vs other branded competitors\u00a0does lock in and honour the price. If COE goes down, they will adjust the your price accordingly)\n\u00a0\nSo to conclude, it was a bad experience for me for the first visit at C&C.Please share what you guys experience specially those who purchased the C205.Thanks!\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited November 24, 2016 by Pohtk\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Soon a SE was \"assign\" to assist me.When approached by the SE, he ask which car im interested in\u00a0so i told him its the C class coupe and would like to have a test drive.\nSo he immediately ask for my driver licence and walk away to prepare the car.\nAlthough I did not ask, he did not brief or show me around the c class coupe, as im not familiar with the equipment or tech that is in it.\n(example like: kick to open boot, auto parking feature, and the audio 20)\n\n\u00a0\nAfter 10mins he arrive with the car and we hop into it.Upon getting into the car, he did not explain to me the controls until i asked him to. Not everyone drives a mercedes right?\nSo\u00a0I was\u00a0briefed for less than\u00a0a min like how to shift gears and\u00a0the signal lights..... that's all.. and off I go.\nThe coupe sits really low and i love it. I test drove the C180 coupe and it feels punchy in the sports+ mode.\nThey don't have the C200 version for me to try it out (omg really C&C??). Requested for C200 sedan but was out for servicing.\nThe suspension is soft and good. Not sure about the sports suspension in AMG line as they only have ONE test drive car.\n\nWhile inside the car i ask about the difference between the C180 vs C200.SE said: \"Oh.. only the engine is bigger...\"\ni said: \"All of that for 25k difference?\"\nSE said: \"Yes\"\ni said: \"i thought the leathery is different?\"\nSE said: \"hmm... ah yes.. the leather is abit different...\"\ni said: \"How about the dash and upper door trims? They look cheap for a almost $200k car, can i pay additional for it to be upholstered\"\nSE said: \"Nope there isn't any.\"\ni said: \"Why not?\"\nSE said: \"All models comes in as standard and we do not have this option.\"\ni siad: \"Even the C200 and C300?\"\nSE said: \"Yes.\"\n(We did talk more in details but these are the gist of it)\n\n\u00a0\nI was pretty sure i've read it before somewhere regarding C180 vs C200\u00a0and here are the difference:1. LED intelligent Light System.\n2. Leather upholstery\n3. Exhaust system with two visible tailpipe trim (not sure what it this... can some one verify?)\n\n\u00a0\nI've found out that someone\u00a0had paid and gotten their car's dash & upper door panel upholstered. Its a new C class coupe too.http://www.sgmerc.com/topic/21318-2016-mercedes-c-class-coupe/\n\nMy conclusion is that the SE is pretty unprepared and unaware of their own products.\nSo the experience was pretty turned off. After the ride, we sit down, no drinks were offered.He eventually did not even quote me a price\u00a0as he said because the COE recently release so he can't provide a proper quote.\nHe did not mention that will get back to me if it does.\nWhat he actually does:\n1. Tell me my current car trade in value. (its pretty low compared to its competitors, up to 7k)\n2. Current 3k OT and 3K service.\n\nHe did not mention of any freebies or existing on running promotion where there actually\u00a0is (early bird promotion for certain models).One of my sibling was there and actually interested in one of the promotional models but he held back and didn't mention until i spoke of the promotion title.\n\n\u00a0\nSo i left the place without knowing much about the car, as he seems \"busy\" and really wish end this quickly.He did not provide any details regarding any good feature that will entice a customer to buy. Nowadays Mercedes cars sells their own right?\nHe told me buying this car now is almost like a\u00a0\"risk\"\u00a0as C&C will not lock any prices even you paid a down payment.\nIf COE went up, you paid the balance, there is no other way unless you forfeit the down payment.\nReason being their waiting time is 6 months.\n(Vs other branded competitors\u00a0does lock in and honour the price. If COE goes down, they will adjust the your price accordingly)\n\n\u00a0\nSo to conclude, it was a bad experience for me for the first visit at C&C.Please share what you guys experience specially those who purchased the C205.\nThanks!\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nI have somewhat similar experience as yours when I was shopping for my first conti ride. During the test drive the SE did not speak much and needed to be prodded to explain the features of the car. Overall I get the sense that the product sells itself and customers will buy anyway so the SEs do not have to do much. The BMW test drive was similar too. Instead of explaining about the car the SE asked me what do I do for a living. Lol what? They were cordial but there is no \"eagerness\". I ended up buying a Volvo, can't complain about the service so far. Recently I test drove Lexus and it was also a better experience comparatively.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I have to probe wif questions etc. He din even go through much of the internals with me either. I actually have to ask what driving mode I'm in. It was in Comfort mode and it felt sluggish. If I've never experience the sports and sports+ mode, I will dim the C180 as a bad performer.\n\u00a0\nI wasn't gona compare the BMW experience as its abt C&C but afterwards i walk across to BMW, its really a different experience. The SE was really friendly, going through the details to me and during the test drive will explain the different driving modes. I tested the 420i and felt its more heavy (more spacious). C180 felt more nibble and more eager to drive in sports+ vs BMW sports mode.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited November 25, 2016 by Pohtk\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Asking too much question will older make you vomit blood or just walk over to BMW. \u00a0 Let's face is, most merc owner are not geek, they bought it not because is a AMG....etc, is all about status.\n\u00a0\nI own one, but the initial experience is the same as yours, seem like they dont bother to improve over the years.\u00a0\nIMO, C180 is good enough, unless you like the extra horse power, then go for C200. The are many types of configuration, but depend on how C&C placed their orders, usually they will just sell you their configuration. \u00a0So to speak, the \"configurators\" in their website are useless. \u00a0Dont compare with other made, cos i feel Merc has it own unique characteristics and a class of it own,\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHope you get your ride soon. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

If you view their OMV, total base cost to import the car and the premium % they charge over it. Merc has the lowest vs bmw or audi.\nDepending on which equivalent class you looking at....Merc general ard 20~40%... bmw / audi can be up to 30~50+% or more.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

A few months back, they were promoting their b class and gave 5k more overtrade for it versus the A class and CLA. Before that they were clearing their C class and the overtrade could be as high as 20k depending on your car. Of course you can sell it outside too. \nDo your sums. The current offer isn't too great IMO. Try waiting till they have the numbers they can offer for the motor show. \nThat deal will only last for the four days of the show.

However, like some Bro said it depends on what models they want to push. \n\u00a0\nFor Merc it depends on what cars/ models are are they receiving from the manufacturer.

The new gearbox, named 9G-Tronic, will replace on medium term the current automatic gearbox 7G-Tronic. The new transmission came out with E 350 BlueTec and it is available now on four versions of CLS facelift (meaning CLS 220 BlueTec, CLS 250 Blue Tec, CLS 350 BlueTec and CLS 500). Subsequently it will also be mounted on other versions of E-Class, C, S, ML and the next GLK.\nThe new gearbox is already being produces at Stuttgart in Germany and it will be made at the Mercedes plant in Sebes, Romania, starting 2016, the production in Romania will have to supplement the demand as the new gearbox is introduced on other models.\nWhat brings this new automatic gearbox and what are the benefits of the additional two gears? Nowadays, the automotive industry follows the motto \u201cthe more the better\u201d.\nThe two extra gears offer a lower rev level at higher speeds: only 1350 rpm at 120 km/h and 2700 rpm at 250 km/h\n\nThe additional two gears provide a direct advantage at least from a certain point of view: the distance between the ratio between the first and the ninth gear is 9.15, which means that it is an important part regarding the efficiency. Thus, E 350 BlueTec can reach higher speeds at incredibly low revs. This translates for instance in driving at 120km/h while the rev counter shows only 1350 rpm and, furthermore, at E 350 BlueTec\u2019s maximum speed of 250km/h is being reached an rev of only 2700 rpm. Through comparison, at the competitors like BMW and Audi, the distance between the ratio from the first and the 8th gear, respectively 7th\u00a0gear is about 8 or 7, thus meaning that at maximum speed, the six-cylinders diesel engines from BMW and Audi are rotating at a higher revs with 500 or even 1000 rpm in the top gear of the transmission. Mercedes pledges for an official average fuel consumption extremely modest for E 350 BlueTech of only 5.3 l/100 km (138g/km CO2 emissions), with a minimum of 4.7 l/100 km for extra urban.\nNot only the efficiency is the advantage of the large distance between the ratio \u00a0from the first and the ninth gear, but also the driving comfort. Theoretically, taking into consideration the huge torque of 620 Nm of the 3-liter diesel available from 1600rpm, the Mercedes engine would do honorable with only three or four gears, while the nine gears offer more refinement and driving comfort.\nWith a weight less than 100 kg, the new 9-speed gearbox is lighter than the actual 7-speed automatic gearbox\n\nDespite the two additional gears and a maximum transferable torque of 1000 Nm, the new transmission does not take more space than the 7 gears one and, furthermore, it is lighter than the previous one, with a weight of less than 100 kg. The gear housing is composed of two components: the aluminum housing of the torque converter and the transmission housing made from magnesium alloy, while the sump is made of plastic. Even though there are two additional gears, the 9-speed transmission also has four semi-axle and six shift elements instead of five as found in the previous gearbox.\nThe main mechanical pump, considerably smaller than the previous one is located close to the main axle, it is chain driven and it is being operated by a auxiliary powered pump. Thus, the lubrication and the cooling are being actively controlled upon request, in order to adapt to the stop & start system. Due to the enhance of the hydraulic circuit from the torque converter, the transmission efficiency goes up till 92%, minimizing the loss in the transfer from the torque to the engine and to the transmission shaft.\nSimilar to the 7G-Tronic Plus, the gearbox provides the Economy, Sport and Manual modes and another Short-term M mode. This is enabled on the Eco and Sport modes only if the drivers engage a certain gear using the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters and it remains active when manually changing the gears or if it maintains a sporty driving style. This is entirely different from the permanent Manual mode available in combination with the AMG Line package declutching it after a period of time.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Good to know that it is just minor issues that can be resolved which is ok I guess.\n\u00a0\nI was intrigued by comment that someone managed to get his suspension changed in 3rd year while under warranty. Wouldn't C&C say that it is wear and tear?  Overall sounds like C&C  quite ok with maintenance in terms of pricing from what I hear.  My experience with PMI quite the opposite. When I asked them to rotate my run flat tyres - the tech refused and said: \"who told you can rotate run flat tyres?\"!  So I listened to them and my front tyres thread didn't last 2.5 years. When my run flat tyre had a puncture they insisted I change the whole tyre. When they tested my battery and it was still 70% good after 3 years, they insisted I change it!\nYa that would be me..Changed the suspension the whole set and engine mountings under warranty just before it ended.\nBy some weird logic gear mounting got pay. Didn't cost much though.\n\u00a0\nService, like others have shared, have nothing to shout about.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Or do you mean cars delivering in 2017. Price gone up $8k means comparing now and earlier in the year prices for the B class?\n\u00a0\nSeems like B class sales is not the focus for C&C as their discounts and overtrade amounts for B class seems to lag far behind that of say GLA or even the A200. The B class sells on it's own and C&C don't need up push the model unlike GLA? Think B class is an established model in the market and have gained acceptance.\n\u00a0\nYou are right to say that C&C was pushing A200 last weekend with higher overtrade for A200. Is it clearing stocks or what? But facelift for A class only in Jan this year. Coupled with drop in list price, this Cat B model sure is an attractive buy.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Deal as published.\n\u00a0\nJust bought GLA180 for my wife. Enjoyed their 10th anniversary promo. Bargained hard and got a great deal. Beyond the published overtrade (OT) incentive, further 10th anniversary discount $3.5k and maintained list prices before last COE jump, got additional OT plus higher trade in car price after some nego. The sweeteners sealed the deal.\n\u00a0\nBoth bought from different sales persons as I wanted to have different buying experiences. Required to take loan for service credits hence i took $50k, 1 year loans.\n\u00a0\nActually christmas promo or 10th anniversary promo all quite similar.

This should result in some much-needed space in the cabin.\n\u00a0\n\n2018 Mercedes-Benz A-Class spy shots\n\u00a0\n\nSpeaking of the cabin, though heavily disguised it appears Mercedes' designers are integrating the central screen with the dash instead of attaching it on as in the current model.\nAnother change is the positioning of the side mirrors. They are now mounted on the doors instead of higher up at the base of the A-pillars. This should result in improved visibility. And those strange markings at the top of the windshield are likely sensors for various driver aids.\nThe new A-Class is expected to be the first model to ride on the next-generation version of the current MFA (Modular Front-drive Architecture) platform used in compact cars from Mercedes and Infiniti. Referred to as MFA2, the next-generation platform will bring weight savings plus greater capacity for alternative drivetrains. A stretched version of this platform will underpin the next B-Class, CLA and even a\u00a0new SUV rumored to be called the GLB.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Now the amount may vary and it will depend on their current promotion and of course the state of your car.\n\u00a0\nEg if they are offering a deal to push the A Class, they will give something like 10k or more to entice you.\nThis is on top of the buy in value. The buy in value is not as good for cars which aren't near scrap.\n\u00a0\nIf you have a 9 plus year old car, that's the ideal. Then you give it to them upon collecting your car.\n\u00a0\nSo the net discount for you can be\n\u00a0\nSRP 150 000\nOT say 10k\nYour scrap value of say 10k\n\u00a0\nSo the NET price of the car is 140k minus the scrap value and the effective amount you pay is 130k. So that's why sometimes you see discrepancies on the amount people say they paid versus the SRP.\n\u00a0\nMerc isn't the only dealer who does this.\nLexus, BMW etc all \u00a0offer this, the OT amount may vary. And it's seasonal. Now for example the OT on the C Class, B Class etc isn't high, because they aren't pushing these cars.\n\u00a0\nSo contact your rep (pm me if you do need one) and then compare.\n\u00a0\nMonths before I closed my deal, the price on the car was almost 10k more, then they dropped the price for a promotion.\n\u00a0\nSo put your ear to the ground and wait ... if you can..\n\n\u00a0\nThanks, this is very helpful. Took me a while to figure it out.\u00a0 My car is 9+ years so just scrap value for me.\u00a0 How much above scrap does Republic typically offer for a BMW3 with 18 months to go?\u00a0 Have a friend who is considering making the switch.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The over trade is actually a form of discount which is already factor in your new car price. They use the term over trade because they want to keep the selling price high so that you can get more loan under MAS ruling. If you think over trade given add on to your paper value then that is wrong. ppl who do not have car to trade in may still get the discount from other means. so this over trade thing is not what you think it is.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But I don't quite understand the rationale, as I agree with earlier comment that the OT is meant to give the perception of a higher price and help the buyer get a larger loan.The overtrade mechanism (OT) is also designed to go some ways to clear the buyer's old car outstanding loan and the nett effect is to have $ left over (after paying off outstanding loan) to help reduce the down payment for new car. Meaning the buyer will fork out less cash as money down to book the new car, making it palatable for new car buyers. This is called incentivizing the sale. That is why OT needs trade in car to work.\u00a0\nThis is an effective tool for selling new cars - by topping up the value of old trade in car and subsidizing from the margin from the new car. However, one needs to be aware of market value of one's old car (can get quotes from car dealers) before negotiating with C&C as used car quotes from Republic Auto are kinda lower than market.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The rebate level is calculated differently and usually there is a clawback of 20% rebate and a 1% penalty on balance.\n\u00a0\nExample, if you take a 6 year loan at 2.68% interest rate for 99k loan, the total interest paid is around 16k. The effective interest rate is a whopping 5%. If you prepay after 1 year, the total interest or extra you paid will be around 8k. Better than 16k but hardly insignificant.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe savings is small because of the penalty which makes the case for prepayment a bit grey. The remaining 5year loan has an effective interest rate of 3.45% (calculated based on the savings) which is on the high side but lower than 5%.\n\u00a0\nI made a spreadsheet for the calculation. If you pay off everything in one month, the interest you will pay is $4.6k which is probably less than the freebies they are offering. That is why most people take the loan. I am not sure if mercedes allow prepayment after one month.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited January 13, 2017 by Wind30\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Last Coe cat a price 50k.\nCla180sb $170888  \nTrade in car expire march 2018.\nTotal over trade of 17.6k assuming delivery before 3march. If later over trade goes up by 1k cuz trade in price is fixed. \n5k service credit. \nSolar film.\nEssential package, with welcome pack\nGuaranteed Coe rebate at 50k\n3D mat, 12 trip pickup/return,  head cushion.\n$400 off first and second year insurance, total 800.\nDiamond grille with chrome pins\nLoan 100k 2.68% 6 years.\nIn house insurance\n\u00a0\nThe nett price is around 153k not factoring in 5k service credit, plus guaranteed Coe with 50k rebate which looks like a good deal.\n\u00a0\nOnce u include the loan, it is probably not a great deal. I calculate the impact of the loan is around 5k vs a 70k 3 year loan. One of a personal reason I have is I want to keep more cash on hand in case i need to buy more big ticket item.\n\u00a0\nThe Coe rebate level is applicable to certain units they want to push out I think. The Color I wanted was don't have it so I chose blue instead.\n\u00a0\nMy community service post. Hopefully this help some people to get a better deal :)\nCongrats n u got a good price!Went to motor show yesterday and there is a $5k discount from list price of $170888 ($3k CNY n $2k motor show discount) n $10k OT which means effective price is $155888 so u got even lower than motorshow price\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited January 14, 2017 by Spring\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

And when it comes to the day you sell it, perhaps that will matter too? Especially the Shooting Brake style, it's really not common\n- RWD vs FWD\n- build quality\u00a0\n- features\n- C180 engine, gearbox are all different\n- legroom + headroom\n- NVH\n\u00a0\nI think the extra outlay amortised over 10 years, isn't that bad. Plus the OMV, resale factored in, IMO, the C180 is a reasonable price for a good car. I don't have that kind of budget, so I didn't go for it, and I don't like S African made cars either, but I just want you to have a think whilst the ink is still wet on your contract.. cheers\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Well at least be clear why you put your hard earned cash on it!\n- do your sums on the outlay, financing etc\n- that includes the loan package, the duration, interest rate etc\n- find a good rep who will serve you well, during the sale and more important, after you have coughed up the dough..\n- look at the spec sheet, and make sure whatever you want is in black and white\n- go through the details, eg, black leather, may come with black trim, and if you want a lighter trim check that\u00a0\n- some things are not included, and you should go through the list that the rep gives you, and get them to sign off on it. If it's not on paper, it's not going to be there. There are no freebies\n\n* Entry level Mercs don't get real leather, and the dash isn't covered with leather either, so do check your specs if you want the real deal.\n\u00a0\nNow for the buying part:\n\u00a0\nSome words about the overtrade:\nhttp://www.mycarforum.com/topic/2703413-mercedes-owners-thread/?p=6021074\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n- check the NETT price, which is what you pay after deducting the overtrade, any further discounts, without including the service credits. Discounts can be offered on certain models, when they need to push for sales on these models, and come on top of the OT.\u00a0\n- add on the scrap car value\n\u00a0\nThat's what you need to pay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen confirm the loan package, interest rate, duration etc.\n\u00a0\nConfirm what's the freebie deal:\n- welcome pack\nA computer backpack, key chain holder, wallet\n- Nano sealant X 2 - do this ASAP to seal in the freshness of the car\n- interior cleaning X 1\n- polish X 1\n- windscreen cleaning X 2\n- chemical wash of the aircon X 3\n- tire repair X 6\n- 12 car pick ups- Huber Optik Solar Film- JS 400 front and back camera- free compact umbrella\n\u00a0\n(your package may vary - eg if you get a higher end model, you may get more)\n\u00a0\nService credits begin at $3000 and up. You can trade it in for cash.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConfirm color of the car, leather type, trim and additional specs - if you customise, the package price may not apply or you need to wait longer\n\u00a0\nConfirm delivery date: this can take months, so make sure you can swop out your existing car at the same time - you may even need to renew road tax\n\u00a0\nOnce you sign, there's a draft contract that you get, and the actual form is sent to you in less than a month. One more contract will be sent nearer the delivery date if it's much later.\n\u00a0\nYou pay the COE deposit of 10k, plus the deposit of 10%. You can use your credit card for this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will also be asked to take up their insurance from AIG for getting the freebies. You can also use your Credit Card for this.\n\u00a0\nIn a few days time, you will get notice of the loan approval. The loan and insurance start when you get your car registered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen the wait begins.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the mean time, you can download the Mercedes Benz guides and MyMB - the app for the manual and the service booking app.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are many functions, so do read up.\n\u00a0\nCOE bidding:\n\u00a0\nMerc usually gives a 6 bid non guaranteed deal, but they will get it for you! The rebate may not be great, but you will get your car.Collection:\n\u00a0\nNow after that seemingly never ending wait, you get your car\u00a0 \u00a0Your rep will call you up, tell you when he will collect that cheque, which happens two to three weeks ahead.You register a few days ahead of the collection, then they install the camera (from Eurostyle JS 400, no park mode) and solar film etc. He will ask you if you want the back window to be darker. The insurance starts once you register, and you can pay for it with your credit card.A few days later, you will then make your way to C&C for the collection.\u00a0\n\nFor budget level cars like the A and B class, you probably have to take delivery at 209 Pandan Gardens. Drive in, park your old car at level two, there will be reserved lots for you. Clear out your old car and head into the special lounge to meet your rep.For higher end cars, they will do the collection at Alex or Ubi etc, and if you ask, they may get things like the Nano Protection done first. For the more basic models, you need to do it separately and do ask your rep if he can allow you to do it right after the collection, so you seal in the fresh paintwork.In the lounge, he will run through the paperwork first, \u00a0insurance, finance etc.Then you will proceed to the car.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo on the day, you can make sure of some checklists like this:\u00a0\nhttp://www.mycarforum.com/topic/1802820-new-car-checklist/\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut the rep will also give you a list to go through. Do take a half day off, it's a good idea to bring a torchlight and go through, looking for scratches and dents. The rep will take you through the functions etc.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou hand over the keys of your old car, get a LTA pin to handover ownership and pass him your old insurance form to sort out. Spend a day taking out the old stuff, don't forget any items under the carpets etc\n\u00a0\nOther items to consider:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere's no 1000km run in, the rep says, so go ahead and enjoy that ride\u00a0 \u00a0Try the various controls, and switches, but main thing is check the paintwork. And take some pics\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited January 18, 2017 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Well at least be clear why you put your hard earned cash on it!\n- do your sums on the outlay, financing etc\n- that includes the loan package, the duration, interest rate etc\n- find a good rep who will serve you well, during the sale and more important, after you have coughed up the dough..\n- look at the spec sheet, and make sure whatever you want is in black and white\n- go through the details, eg, black leather, may come with black trim, and if you want a lighter trim check that \n- some things are not included, and you should go through the list that the rep gives you, and get them to sign off on it. If it's not on paper, it's not going to be there. There are no freebies\n\u00a0\n* Entry level Mercs don't get real leather, and the dash isn't covered with leather either, so do check your specs if you want the real deal.\n\u00a0\nNow for the buying part:\n\u00a0\nSome words about the overtrade:\nhttp://peteswrite.blogspot.sg/2017/01/overtrade-how-does-it-work.html\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n- check the NETT price, which is what you pay after deducting the overtrade, any further discounts, without including the service credits. Discounts can be offered on certain models, when they need to push for sales on these models, and come on top of the OT. \n- add on the scrap car value\n\u00a0\nThat's what you need to pay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen confirm the loan package, interest rate, duration etc.\n\u00a0\nConfirm what's the freebie deal:\n- welcome pack\nA computer backpack, key chain holder, wallet\n- Nano sealant X 2 - do this ASAP to seal in the freshness of the car\n- interior cleaning X 1\n- polish X 1\n- windscreen cleaning X 2\n- chemical wash of the aircon X 3\n- tire repair X 6\n- 12 car pick ups\n- Huber Optik Solar Film\n- JS 400 front and back camera\n- free compact umbrella\n\u00a0\n(your package may vary - eg if you get a higher end model, you may get more)\n\u00a0\nService credits begin at $3000 and up. You can trade it in for cash.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConfirm color of the car, leather type, trim and additional specs - if you customise, the package price may not apply or you need to wait longer\n\u00a0\nConfirm delivery date: this can take months, so make sure you can swop out your existing car at the same time - you may even need to renew road tax\n\u00a0\nOnce you sign, there's a draft contract that you get, and the actual form is sent to you in less than a month. One more contract will be sent nearer the delivery date if it's much later.\n\u00a0\nYou pay the COE deposit of 10k, plus the deposit of 10%. You can use your credit card for this. \n\u00a0\nYou will also be asked to take up their insurance from AIG for getting the freebies. You can also use your Credit Card for this.\n\u00a0\nIn a few days time, you will get notice of the loan approval. The loan and insurance start when you get your car registered. \n\u00a0\nThen the wait begins. \n\u00a0\nIn the mean time, you can download the Mercedes Benz guides and MyMB - the app for the manual and the service booking app. \n\u00a0\nThere are many functions, so do read up.\n\u00a0\nCOE bidding:\n\u00a0\nMerc usually gives a 6 bid non guaranteed deal, but they will get it for you! The rebate may not be great, but you will get your car.\n\u00a0\nCollection:\n\u00a0\nNow after that seemingly never ending wait, you get your car  \n\u00a0\nYour rep will call you up, tell you when he will collect that cheque, which happens two to three weeks ahead.\n\u00a0\nYou register a few days ahead of the collection, then they install the camera (from Eurostyle JS 400, no park mode) and solar film etc. He will ask you if you want the back window to be darker. The insurance starts once you register, and you can pay for it with your credit card.\n\u00a0\nA few days later, you will then make your way to C&C for the collection. \n\u00a0\nFor budget level cars like the A and B class, you probably have to take delivery at 209 Pandan Gardens. Drive in, park your old car at level two, there will be reserved lots for you. Clear out your old car and head into the special lounge to meet your rep.\n\u00a0\nFor higher end cars, they will do the collection at Alex or Ubi etc, and if you ask, they may get things like the Nano Protection done first. For the more basic models, you need to do it separately and do ask your rep if he can allow you to do it right after the collection, so you seal in the fresh paintwork.\n\u00a0\nIn the lounge, he will run through the paperwork first,  insurance, finance etc.\n\u00a0\nThen you will proceed to the car. \n\u00a0\nSo on the day, you can make sure of some checklists like this: \nhttp://peteswrite.blogspot.sg/2016/08/checklist-when-buying-car.html\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut the rep will also give you a list to go through. Do take a half day off, it's a good idea to bring a torchlight and go through, looking for scratches and dents. The rep will take you through the functions etc.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou hand over the keys of your old car, get a LTA pin to handover ownership and pass him your old insurance form to sort out. Spend a day taking out the old stuff, don't forget any items under the carpets etc\n\u00a0\nOther items to consider:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere's no 1000km run in, the rep says, so go ahead and enjoy that ride  \n\u00a0\nTry the various controls, and switches, but main thing is check the paintwork. And take some pics  \n\nGood write-up but it neglected to mention that for a very few models, you get a delivery party and champagne. Adding for completeness. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I have the habit of skipping through the gears rapidly, like from sixth to third.\nWhen I was driving a manual car, I used to shift directly from fourth to second gear. There was no damage to my manual car's gearbox then. But if I do it with my current car's paddle shifters, will I damage or wear out the transmission prematurely?\nUnlike manual transmissions, it is not possible to shift directly from sixth to third in an automatic car.\nYou need to run down the sequence, through fifth and fourth, before arriving at third.\nIn a manual box, the driver did all the clutch work.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn an automated manual gearbox such as a double-clutch transmission, the computer makes all the decisions and commands the actuator to do the \"clutch\" work.\nAs the system is computer- controlled, there is no danger of shifting to a lower gear if the speed is too high for the ratio.\nNo matter how many times you flick the paddle, it will never switch from sixth to first, for example, at a speed of 80kmh.\nIt works for upshifts too. The transmission will not allow you to select a high gear if the speed is too low.\nSo there is no risk of damaging your vehicle's transmission if you paddle down (or up) rapidly.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Aside from the well-documented advantages of  having a dashcam (read up, watch videos), it can be unobtrusive. For my part, placed it somewhere behind the rear mirror of my previous C180K and ran the wires on the cladding (if that's what it is called) of the windscreen and into my glove compartment where there is a power adapter/outlet. Didn't need a technician to install it and also didn't think any warranty will be affected. This is the \"over-the-counter\" dashcam that i used (and lots more in the market), just worth $200 but it gave me peace of mind:https://www.transcend-info.com/Products/No-692\n\u00a0\nIt does not monitor when parked but you can check Blackvue, more expensive and has battery cut-off so that the car battery won't be drained -- but for this you may want to think about possible warranty implications. It's a pity Merc doesn't have one of this:\nhttp://www.pml-bmw.com.sg/en/topics/offers-and-services/special-offers/offer_careye.html\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited January 25, 2017 by jonesy\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I also try to avoid using the radio / charging my phone etc when the car engine is turned off.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI also shortened the duration of the \"Go Home\" and interior ambient lights, in an effort to save wear on the battery.\nHowever, I will definitely want a DVR.

If there is one tyre rotation out of timing it will display \"check tyre pressure\". Lower pressure on tyre affect the diameter therefore also affect rotation timing. After preussure confirmed on all 4 tyres then need to reset the system.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited February 1, 2017 by Knighthunter\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But The proper way to plug the leak is to remove the tyre and insert from the inside. Cleaning up the slime is a pain in the ass and You need to prep the area of the puncture well to make sure the internal patch sticks. Most tire shops will be very reluctant to patch like this due to the mess. But still can internal patch if they take the effort to do so. \n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited February 3, 2017 by Mkl22\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Know how you feel!\u00a0 \u00a0 I went though all that hand wringing last year! I test drove the CLA180, CLA200\u00a0and C180. Decided to go with the C180 eventually\u00a0for the ride quality, handling and spaciousness.\u00a0 CLA ride felt harder since it is meant to be sportier\u00a0and\u00a0my head was touching the roof in the rear passenger seat.\u00a0Also \u00a0I used to drive a 3 series so I like\u00a0RWD.

But I have to enable it again mid-drive cuz it turns off after like a few minutes. \n\u00a0\nAny ideas if this is normal?\nThey auto turn off one. No timing but probably after 15-30mins. Stupid German go design such aircon, they think every country is the same as germany, having a clean air.

After I paired once, all my calls get routed to the car and I can access music via bluetooth without taking out my HP ever. The car just seems to know my HP is in the car. This makes the apple carplay kind of useless as I have to physically connect my iphone to the USB port. Do any of you use apple carplay regularly? If I need GPS, I almost always find it easier to use it on the phone itself, due to the touch screen UI. The apply car play UI hard to use due to lack of touch screen, unless I use SIRI which i am not familiar with. I asked my SE if CnC has an iphone dock, she says don't have. Is that true? Kind of weird to give apple carplay and don't have a dock....\n\u00a0\nMy Aircon has to be set to 23.5 deg to feel cold. If it is set to 24 deg, it is just cool. Seems to be a regular issue with CLA180, not a big deal.\n\u00a0\nEco start stop. This is probably discussed many times. I tried running with ECO start stop but it seems to be pretty useless. It will switch off the engine, but with the aircon set at 23.5deg, music on, it turns on maybe after 1 min, even before the light turns green sometimes. With the outside temperature being so warm in Singapore, the aircon has to work hard almost all the time, so eco start stop seems to be limited by the battery? Has anyone use this regularly? Does it increase the wear and tear on the Engine/Battery?\n\u00a0\nI am thinking if CnC can set the default to disable for Eco start stop.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI did not know my car comes with active park assist, ie the car can park itself turning the steering wheel, all you need is to press the throttle. Tried it once, almost hit the low kerb on the side.... don't dare to try again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited February 23, 2017 by Wind30\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Fortunately, I was able to pull in to a rest stop. But I was surprised to discover that there was no spare tyre. Instead there was something called a tyre repair kit. I was at a loss because I had no idea how to use the kit. Is this normal and unique to my car?\nFirst and foremost, when you embark on a long-distance drive, you must give your vehicle a thorough check, including all the tyres (the spare too).\nThese days, many cars do not come with a spare tyre. To reduce weight and for convenience, a tyre repair kit is now a common flat-tyre fix, so you must know how to use it.\nThe repair kit comes with a puncture sealant and a tyre pump. What you need to do in the event of a puncture is clearly described in the owner's manual and, in most cases, on the repair kit itself.\nThe operation is fairly simple. First, you inject the pressurised can of sealant into the punctured tyre. You may then need to move the car a little to rotate the tyre so that the sealant is distributed evenly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWait a few minutes for the puncture to be sealed. Instructions on the can will state how many minutes. Then, plug in the compressor to the cigarette lighter socket, connect the pressure tube of the pump to the tyre valve and start the compressor. The pump has a gauge so you will know when the pressure is right.\nThe repair is not meant to be permanent. You should have the damaged tyre changed at the next town.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Didn't try to further change to 'R' though.\n\u00a0\nWhen you are in Neutral gear and step on the accelerator, it will rev up the engine without engaging your drive-train aka wheels.

E and above will be like 5k. A, B and C i think only 3k but can ask for more. i did it for my other car. usually within 500$more\n2.. JS front back camera sure give\n3. insurance some loyalty discount for next two year renewal.\n4. 3D matt\n5. solar film\n6. some car essential package inclusive nano coat.\n7. welcome pack.. laptop\u00a0bag.\n8. some amount of overtrade\u00a0\n9. 12 or more pick ups for servicing\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nwhere to find accessories:\n\u00a0\nFor a brick and mortar shop options:\n\u00a0\nAutobacs:\n- the biggest selection, you can touch, ask questions etc\n\u00a0\nNTUC:\nsurprisingly good\n\u00a0\nSGgarage, and a few others. Mod shops that also sell some kit that you can add on.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor serious electrical mods;\n\u00a0\nElebest:\n\u00a0\nMax does all kinds of stuff:\u00a0GPS,\u00a0keyless, etc\n\u00a0\nONLINE:\n\u00a0\nAh this is where the interesting stuff begins:\n\u00a0\nAmazon:\nAmazing place where you can get stuff that suits all kinds of cars. And don't limit yourself to Amazon USA. For the Merc, which is German in origin, try search in Amazon UK and De. They may be cheaper, and offer more options. Things like\u00a0car mats, wipers, replacement parts, and more.\n\u00a0\nEbay:\nA traditional source, and I might get my window visors from there. Made in USA and sells for the same price as the ones from ebay Malaysia.\n\u00a0\nAliexpress:\nA huge market place, and like Taobao, it offers many items, which are not just made in China. I got a console shelf that fits in the console box between the seats, plus some red control knobs. Do compare prices, and see if it's cheaper than Amazon and vice versa.\n\u00a0\nTaobao:\nAnother large market, but it's in Chinese and I am not too familiar. There are options to ship over, so one can consider that too. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nBuying and collecting\n\u00a0\n- check the NETT price, which is what you pay after deducting the overtrade, any further discounts, without including the service credits. Discounts can be offered on certain models, when they need to push for sales on these models, and come on top of the OT.\u00a0\n- add on the scrap car value\n\u00a0\nThat's what you need to pay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen confirm the loan package, interest rate, duration etc.\n\u00a0\nConfirm what's the freebie deal:\n- welcome pack\nA computer backpack, key chain holder, wallet\n- Nano sealant X 2 - do this ASAP to seal in the freshness of the car\n- interior cleaning X 1\n- polish X 1\n- windscreen cleaning X 2\n- chemical wash of the aircon X 3\n- tire repair X 6\n- 12 car pick ups- Huber Optik Solar Film- JS 400 front and back camera- free compact umbrella\n\u00a0\n(your package may vary - eg if you get a higher end model, you may get more)\n\u00a0\nService credits begin at $3000 and up. You can trade it in for cash.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nConfirm color of the car, leather type, trim and additional specs - if you customise, the package price may not apply or you need to wait longer\n\u00a0\nConfirm delivery date: this can take months, so make sure you can swop out your existing car at the same time - you may even need to renew road tax\n\u00a0\nOnce you sign, there's a draft contract that you get, and the actual form is sent to you in less than a month. One more contract will be sent nearer the delivery date if it's much later.\n\u00a0\nYou pay the COE deposit of 10k, plus the deposit of 10%. You can use your credit card for this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou will also be asked to take up their insurance from AIG for getting the freebies. You can also use your Credit Card for this.\n\u00a0\nIn a few days time, you will get notice of the loan approval. The loan and insurance start when you get your car registered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen the wait begins.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn the mean time, you can download the Mercedes Benz guides and MyMB - the app for the manual and the service booking app.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere are many functions, so do read up.\n\u00a0\nCOE bidding:\n\u00a0\nMerc usually gives a 6 bid non guaranteed deal, but they will get it for you! The rebate may not be great, but you will get your car.Collection:\n\u00a0\nNow after that seemingly never ending wait, you get your car\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Your rep will call you up, tell you when he will collect that cheque, which happens two to three weeks ahead.You register a few days ahead of the collection, then they install the camera (from Eurostyle JS 400, no park mode) and solar film etc. He will ask you if you want the back window to be darker. The insurance starts once you register, and you can pay for it with your credit card.A few days later, you will then make your way to C&C for the collection.\u00a0\n\nFor budget level cars like the A and B class, you probably have to take delivery at 209 Pandan Gardens. Drive in, park your old car at level two, there will be reserved lots for you. Clear out your old car and head into the special lounge to meet your rep.For higher end cars, they will do the collection at Alex or Ubi etc, and if you ask, they may get things like the Nano Protection done first. For the more basic models, you need to do it separately and do ask your rep if he can allow you to do it right after the collection, so you seal in the fresh paintwork.In the lounge, he will run through the paperwork first, \u00a0insurance, finance etc.Then you will proceed to the car.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo on the day, you can make sure of some checklists like this:\u00a0\nhttp://www.mycarforu...-car-checklist/\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut the rep will also give you a list to go through. Do take a half day off, it's a good idea to bring a torchlight and go through, looking for scratches and dents. The rep will take you through the functions etc.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou hand over the keys of your old car, get a LTA pin to handover ownership and pass him your old insurance form to sort out. Spend a day taking out the old stuff, don't forget any items under the carpets etc\n\u00a0\nOther items to consider:\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere's no 1000km run in, the rep says, so go ahead and enjoy that ride\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Try the various controls, and switches, but main thing is check the paintwork. And take some pics\u00a0\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited March 19, 2017 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

That numeric pad was one of the nice touches which I am glad to see. And the buttons have a positive feels. Merc raided the parts bins of the higher models, so you don't feel that the interior of the MFA cars is too low rent. In fact it's a nice introduction to the Merc world.\nShared parts also means lowered costs.\nCannot accept paying a premium for non auto climate control air con system.

Given the similar price point, would you guys get the new C43 AMG or the base model Cayman?\n\u00a0\nIs the price point similar? I thought the C43 was a tad more ex - about 10k+?\n\u00a0\nAnyway, I have not driven the Cayman. But I have driven the C43.\n\u00a0\nWasn't too impressed. The car simply doesn't feel urgent enough. Let me wanting a lot more.\n\u00a0\nBetween those two, I would seriously look at the Porsche - but again, I need to drive the Cayman to be sure. While I have lots of experience with DCTs in general, I have to confess I have limited experience with the PDK. I have tested a RUF 3800S with a DCT, but I'm not sure if it's equivalent to the PDK you get in a Porsche badged car. Still, a DCT transmission of any sort is still preferable to an auto (the C43 has a nine-speed auto).\n\u00a0\nHonestly, the C43 is considered an AMG-lite, not a fully-fledged AMG as such. The engine itself is not made at Affalterbach. In that sense, it is similar to my BMW M140i (the \"M performance\" line, informally considered \"M-lite\"). And now I'm going to make a pitch for my car or the close cousin, the M240i. Even though they're down on raw power compared to the C43, they also weigh less so the power:weight is actually higher on the Bimmers. Try driving one of these - they're quicker than an M2 in a straight line at legal speeds (and a bit above). Even though the transmission is also a torque converter auto, it's the practically bulletproof ZF 8-speed, which I love. Seriously, if you're thinking of the C43, get one of these and save yourself nearly 100k and put a bigger smile on your face.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

It's very nice. I have had a car (the M135i) with the N55 engine, so I can tell you that this new engine is significantly torquier.\n\u00a0\n\nThird party testing consistently shows the M(x)40i cars to be quicker in a straight line to at least 100km/h than the M2.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

And there is a $ sign on the customers forehead.\nHowever, a person who doesnt buy today may buy another day. So sales people show never just size people up and think that is it. \n\u00a0\nIn any case and ultimately the point we are making is about simply dressing appropriately and being considerate to the event or occasion.  \n\u00a0\nNot about sizing up ir being sized up\n Not just car showroom but all other instances.   \nAgain theres no need to dress specially to the nines, only just neat and tidy. \n\u00a0\nIt is just a bit of self respect and courtesy.\nVery simple.

This attitude will get remembered. In sales or any industry, one's reputation is important.. Especially when one is commission based.\n\nWhile this may hold water by logic, sad to say not everybody thinks the same way. There are worst SEs, on their turn to serve and sighting 1st impression just through the showroom door, whips out phone from the pocket and inform receptionist urgent phone call / urgent \"big \" call need to go washroom. \"Deliberate tampered attempt not to serve!!!\"\n\u00a0\nActually it does not affect much UNLESS the particular individuals name is smeared and tarnished so notoriously in the industry. After all, merc is also considered a bread & butter mass market brand. Most of the SE's are just ORDER TAKERS. Usually, the top SEs will always be the few, they are able to perform consistently because of their mindcept mentality. \nThese top SEs are usually:\n1. They will think themselves as their own boss and their livelihood as a business.\n2. The car make & model is just but only a product and tool for them.\n3. Hardworking, humble, polite, down to earth with very high EQ.\n4. Take effort to follow up, how many just walk in and buy immediately?\n5. Impress with their car knowledge and general auto industry knowledge, general knowledge.\n+ few more attributes! the standard package \"GUARANTEED COE\" one la!!! Hahah\n\u00a0\nAnd for the higher up brands, top SEs get a sale done without talking much about the car itself!!! This is really a top notch class!! How's that ??\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Bye Bye F10\u00a0@RadX\n\nIs the price point similar? I thought the C43 was a tad more ex - about 10k+?\n\u00a0\nAnyway, I have not driven the Cayman. But I have driven the C43.\n\u00a0\nWasn't too impressed. The car simply doesn't feel urgent enough. Let me wanting a lot more.\n\u00a0\nBetween those two, I would seriously look at the Porsche - but again, I need to drive the Cayman to be sure. While I have lots of experience with DCTs in general, I have to confess I have limited experience with the PDK. I have tested a RUF 3800S with a DCT, but I'm not sure if it's equivalent to the PDK you get in a Porsche badged car. Still, a DCT transmission of any sort is still preferable to an auto (the C43 has a nine-speed auto).\n\u00a0\nHonestly, the C43 is considered an AMG-lite, not a fully-fledged AMG as such. The engine itself is not made at Affalterbach. In that sense, it is similar to my BMW M140i (the \"M performance\" line, informally considered \"M-lite\"). And now I'm going to make a pitch for my car or the close cousin, the M240i. Even though they're down on raw power compared to the C43, they also weigh less so the power:weight is actually higher on the Bimmers. Try driving one of these - they're quicker than an M2 in a straight line at legal speeds (and a bit above). Even though the transmission is also a torque converter auto, it's the practically bulletproof ZF 8-speed, which I love. Seriously, if you're thinking of the C43, get one of these and save yourself nearly 100k and put a bigger smile on your face.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Can't go wrong with a Porkey. \u00a0\nBtw, with regard to engine note of the Bimmers, remember that what you're hearing inside the car is almost totally fake synthetic sound (active sound). The interior fake sound of the M2 sounds a lot more aggressive than that of the M(x)40i. But if you listen from the outside, the M2 is only just nicer than the M(x)40i.

Also, the Mercedes E-Class Cabriolet is the only model that caught my eye.\nBefore I embark on the journey of a Merc owner, I would like to hear from the various owners what are the common problems of the Mercedes E200 or E250 Cabriolet of 2010 or 2011.\nIn addition, I am also interested to know how's the maintenance cost for the\u00a0Mercedes E200 or E250 Cabriolet of 2010 or 2011.\nCurrently, I'm driving a Volvo S80 and would very much like to switch to a Mercedes despite me receiving a lot of privileges as a Volvo owner.

Rock. Honest boss, did not charge for consultation. He told me that my w213 is still under warranty and better claim from c& c. He did a simple diagnostic to check my compressor. The result was little air con compressor leakage for my four months new car. Went to c& c today to rectify and they told me to leave my car for thorough checking again. Hopefully will get the result and drive my car back from leng kee workshop soon. Simple work takes days, Jia lat slow. Thank God, I still got my son in law fetch me home.

In the center of the front windscreen, I've seen that there is an open view area below the rear view mirror area. I'm wondering if this is the factory fitted camera for this car model? My ride was fitted with an front camera which is below the rear view mirror.\n2nd Q was that every day, I need to manually change the drive mode to Individual as I hate the econ mode where it turns off the engine when waiting for the green traffic lights. Any idea how to make it stay in Individual mode?\nBTW, I had asked the Sales Rep and they don't know.\n\u00a0\nThanks\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nI think the drive mode defaults to Comfort in all Mercedes cars. Same with my GT. I need to manually switch it to Individual when I want to. This happens after the ignition has been switched off for a few hours (never looked at the exact time cut off, though). If the ignition is turned on a short while after turning off, the last mode is \"remembered\".\n\u00a0\nThe way it goes is this: Ignition switched off. Turned back on within a certain time (T1): car retains last used mode, and start up revs remain low VS turned back on within a slightly longer time (T2): car retains mode, but start up revs are high (cold start mode) VS turned back on after an even longer time (T3): full cold start behaviour: start up revs are high and default Comfort mode engaged.\n\u00a0\nA recode can probably get the car to behave the way you want. But a recode will almost certainly also void your warranty. It is also possible you will lose your coding with the next service (when they reset the computer or whatever).\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 24, 2017 by Turboflat4\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I feel a little out of place..\n\u00a0\nBut kudos to the service team, if you tell them nicely and specifically what you want, they do help.. after so many negative stories about service centres in general, it was a relief to find that they aren't ogres ..\n\u00a0\nThey also clean up the car, inside and outside even if you bring it in for a noise issue. They even clean the engine bay, for free.\n\u00a0\nThe puffs are quite tasty, and the coffee is nice, pity the Pandan centre is so Ulu.. perhaps it's to prevent people coming here for freebies... ha ha\n\n\u00a0\nHaha, don't think that way bro, we're all part of the Mersilly family. \n\u00a0\nThe AMG service team (as in the mechs) are great, although I have my favourite.\n\u00a0\nThe service advisors (as in the gentlemen in office shirts) - well, you have to find one that's really good and stick with him. I won't say more. But many sincere thanks to someone in this forum with far more experience with AMGs (now more into Ferraris), who helped to intro me to a great guy. It was touch and go before that. Ironically, it was when I got my 430 that I became quite good friends with him because I never had a Merc before this, LOL. \n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, I'll never get to try the pastries. No place in SG is that ulu lah, I still go Munich to chat with people - the coffee is better there!  :D\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 24, 2017 by Turboflat4\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Turned back on within a certain time (T1): car retains last used mode, and start up revs remain low VS turned back on within a slightly longer time (T2): car retains mode, but start up revs are high (cold start mode) VS turned back on after an even longer time (T3): full cold start behaviour: start up revs are high and default Comfort mode engaged.\n\u00a0\nA recode can probably get the car to behave the way you want.

They've also saved millions of gallons of gas from mileage-draining under pressured tires.\nBut boy do they also cause some\u00a0major headaches for owners and installers alike.\u00a0Of the many headaches commonly associated with TPMS monitors, clearly, the achiest and breakiest is the valve stems.\n\u00a0\nFirst-generation monitors especially, are not only showing the effects of age, but of some rather thoughtless design. Because so many of these sensors are a one-piece design, with the metal valve stem built into the sensor, any damage to the relatively cheap valve stem can make the expensive sensor simply useless.\nAnd these metal valve stems do corrode and break far too easily. Valve stems on TPMS monitors can corrode for a number of different reasons. Knowing these reasons and how to prevent them can mean the difference between happy driving and disaster.PROBLEM: METAL VALVE CAPSWhile the bright and shiny chrome plated or metal valve caps that you see everywhere are often a nice effect compared to dull black plastic caps, when it comes to TPMS stems, they're a clear and present danger. Metal caps can easily cause corrosion on the threads of TPMS stems as well as beginning to corrode themselves.\n\u00a0\nThe result is all too often that the cap will rust-weld itself to the stem, leading to outcomes from the cap simply seizing when a technician tries to remove it, to cross threading issues, or even having the stem break off entirely. When the valve stem is a nonremovable part of the TPMS monitor, this goes from being a minor issue to a critical and often expensive problem.\n\u00a0SOLUTION: RUBBER VALVE CAPSIt's simple: Do not ever put metal valve caps on your TPMS valve stems. Black plastic or rubber caps may be dull and boring, but boring can be good. Having your expensive monitors turned to junk by corrosion is excitement you don't need. As Barry Steinberg from Direct Tire told me, \u201cInitially they were putting out a lot of metal caps on these metal valve stems and they were seizing and cracking and breaking. But ever since they've all gone to rubber valve caps we've seen a lot less of that.\u201dPROBLEM: BRASS VALVE CORESInside every valve stem is a part called the valve core. It's the part that you press down on to let air out of your tires, and it can also be unscrewed and removed with a special tool to let air out of the tires really fast. Most of the rubber snap-in valve stems out there use valve cores made of brass. Because TPMS metal valve stems are usually aluminum, they cannot use brass cores. The reason is that brass will react to the aluminum and cause the core to weld itself to the stem, making it impossible to remove. The absurdity of the situation is clear \u2013 an untrained tire tech, or just one who is not paying attention that day, can cause the destruction of a hundred-dollar TPMS sensor by installing the wrong fifty-cent valve core.SOLUTION: NICKEL-COATED VALVE CORESThe only type of valve cores that can be used in TPMS sensors are the specialized nickel-coated cores that are specifically designed to go in the valve stems. It's pretty easy to tell the difference, as the brass valve cores are, well, brass-colored, and nickel cores are silver. It's an easy and important check to remove your valve caps after any work has been done and make sure that yours are silver. If they're not, have them replaced as soon as possible. The nickel-coated cores also need to be replaced with new ones every time they are removed, as the coating is thin and can wear off simply from the action of threading and removing them, which will expose the brass under the coating.PROBLEM: AIR, WATER, AND SALTThe last reason that TPMS valve stems corrode is simply unavoidable.\nStems are exposed to the air, they get wet, and especially in winter conditions, they get exposed to road salt and salt water. Corrosion is just a fact of life when it comes to metal parts, and valve stems are exposed every minute of the day. Collet nuts, the parts that screw down over the valve stem to tighten the whole assembly against the valve stem hole are especially vulnerable to the same kind of corrosion that can cause a valve cap or valve core to seize. Horror stories abound of collet nuts seizing, valve stems breaking at the slightest pressure applied by tire techs trying to remove them, and even of stems breaking off while the vehicle is in motion.SOLUTION: PROPER MAINTENANCEThe only solution to environmental corrosion is constant vigilance, mostly in the form of service packs. Service packs are small packets that tire dealers and installers keep with all the tiny parts and widgets that need to be replaced every time your tires are serviced. These packs will include:\nA new nickel-coated valve core.\nA new rubber or plastic valve cap.\nA new set of rubber gaskets to seal the valve hole in the wheel.\nA new collet nut.\nService packs, you may note, therefore cover all of the major reasons for corrosion problems I have already noted, that being the major reason they exist. By replacing each of these parts every time your tires are serviced, you keep corrosion at bay, preventing it from gaining a foothold in the cracks and crevices between all these seemingly insignificant little parts. This is why the service packs are so important, why responsible installers will always replace them, and why you should always resist the temptation to save the small fee that they will have to charge you for doing so.\nThere is also a much more permanent, if somewhat more expensive way of solving TPMS corrosion problems, which is to replace your first-generation TPMS sensors with\u00a0second-generation aftermarket sensors.\u00a0Most aftermarket sensors now use a removable snap-in rubber valve stem that not only completely avoids most corrosion problems, but can be easily and cheaply replaced if it is damaged.\nThis is an especially good option to look at if your sensors are more than 6 years old, as the batteries on TPMS sensors are rated to last about 6-7 years, and cannot be replaced. That's another headache entirely.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 30, 2017 by Vratenza\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

FYI. i was given 30k OT and i have to bargain hard to make sure they take my car at market rate which was then 10k lower CnC quoted from market rate. that is why i said age of the trade in car plays a part as the min value they have to offer is paper value.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

A typical Japanese 1.6 is 4l and 2.0l is 5l. Thus you get 15k intervals for merc and 10k Japanese. But jaguar somehow manages to quote a oil change interval of 32k km or 20k miles for their diesels.

Cheers\n\n\u00a0\nNo lah, probably only about 7-9k cheaper which could be attributed to the COE plunge. Don't forget that the same amount of discount was given before the COE plunged, only labeled differently. CNC really firm on pricing, given that Merc is one of their best selling brands.\n\u00a0\nFor example, during the Vivo roadshow the following discount was offered:\n\u00a0\nCASH DISCOUNT\n$8000 overtrade\n$5000 Vivo discount\n$800 + $400 + $400 insurance rebate (3yrs total)\n\u00a0\nCREDITS\n$4000 service credit\n\u00a0\nNow, you only get $15k overtrade and if you take 60% loan, you get the $4000 service credit.\n\u00a0\nCome up to be about the same, discount wise. But now's better because COE is lower and you're paying 7k less than a month ago. Why not?!!!\n\u00a0\nAnyway, I find the bucket seat really comfortable. Maybe because he's too big?\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited July 13, 2017 by Pmet\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Disregards the badge, and examine objectively the space, ergonomics etc and see if paying about 40k for a Hungarian car vs a Thai one is still ok.\n(2017 Corolla is about 110k, with more safety features than the 2016 version by far)\nIf it still is, then on price alone, 150k is quite low for the CLA 180. Good price.\n\u00a0\nCheers\nSpace wise, the Corolla has about the same space as the C Class, even more than the CLA.. ambience and all is obviously lacking... but think mee pok vs fettuccine...\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited July 15, 2017 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

C&C's advertised 'discount' is not really a discount coz they minus off the 'insurance rebate', 'service credit', 'overtrade' and show the lower \"effective price\". But in reality, buyer pays for all this as the invoice & loan is based on list price.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

On one side is the true DNA of Mercedes benz, rear wheel drive, luxuriously finished, made in Germany, the c class, e class ..... and above.On the other side are the \"cheap\" ones, meant to compete with Japanese. A & B class and their variants. To cut cost, it's front wheel drive, made in cheaper countries, quite a lot more plastic being used in the car etc. Target market are the \"cannot afford MB customers\" but die die want to buy young buyers.Just find it amusing. Anyway MB, are generally well engineered and SAFE.3 financial questions to clear b4 buying luxurious car:1) Protection: Hv u got adequate insurance ( life, hospital, accident, critical illness)2) Retirement: Do u hv enough to retire (bet u don even know how much u need)3) Investment & savings: what is your networth, do u make regular investments..... and legacy planning if u consider bequest for yr childrenIf people plan financially, there will far less imprudent splurge on luxurious cars.\nhttp://www.car-engineer.com/mercedes-cla-is-the-most-aerodynamic-production-car-of-the-world/\n\u00a0\nNot bad for a Hungarian made sedan..\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWith a drag coefficient (Cd) value of 0.23, the CLA sets a new benchmark \u2013 both within the Mercedes-Benz model range and among all production vehicles. The drag area, Cd x A \u2013 which is crucial to aerodynamic resistance \u2013 also leads the field, at 0.51 m\u00b2. This record figure is undercut still further by the CLA 180 BlueEFFICIENCY Edition, which will be launched in June 2013. In this case the Cd figure is 0.22, while in terms of wind resistance the four-door coup\u00e9 manages to breach another magic barrier: the figure here is just 0.49 m\u00b2.\n\nThe good air flow characteristics, which are a major contributory factor to the vehicle\u2019s low fuel consumption in everyday conditions, result from numerous aerodynamic optimization measures. These include the following features:\nlarge diffusor cover\naero baffles\noptimized rear muffler\naero covers for spring links\ncover for rear axle subframe\noptimized main cover\nslotted wheel house liner\noptimized lower stiffener\nengine cover\ndemand controlled cooling air, using adjustable radiator shutter\noptimized front apron\nlarge area of underbody paneling and additional cladding in the center rear axle area\nserrated wheel spoilers at the front and rear wheels\nslotted wheel arch linings\nlow A-pillar shoulder\naerodynamically optimized exterior mirror housings\naerodynamically optimized rear end design (flush sitting boot lid and fins in tail lights)\naerodynamically optimized rear silencer with downstream diffuser\nwheels and tires with low air resistance\n\n\n\u00a0\nMost aerodynamic cars you can buy now:\nhttps://drivemag.com/news/the-most-aerodynamic-cars-you-can-buy-right-now\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\tThe 0.26 Cd ClubCars that have under 0.27 Cd are quite sparse.

Any complains on this ride that potential buyer should be aware of\u00a0 (mechanically and electrically)\n\u00a0\nThanks\n\nWell bro, if you check out the local and foreign forums, you will find the discussions are quite short on complaints, and compared to many other brands, you find less trouble-shooting posts, less posts on 'why doesn't this work, why does this rattle, or why did this fail'..\n\u00a0\nBatteries still die - I think that's user dependant, and some panels are still not as well made as the old W214 E class or old S Class. But it's made in Germany, and the DCT is a wet one, used since 2011 in many MFA based cars.\n\u00a0\nSo what my rep said is that the steering wheel may peel if you use creams, and the seat belt area is a bit flimsy, and I found the panel alignment as well as the plastic used in the lower sections to be a bit disappointing, but otherwise, it's been a fun year. But I am an new owner, so bring a pro along and see. Google and you will know what I mean on the scarcity of complaints.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDo note the DCT is smoother in the post facelift models, and the ride is also better. The newer ones also come with the LED headlamps and a nicer display.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Alas, it looks like that might be coming to an end.\u00a0AutoGuide\u00a0has spotted\u00a0that\u00a0Mercedeshas trademarked a new naming convention in\u00a0Canada\u00a0and other markets.Essentially, regular-series Mercedes will continue to end in a zero, but there will only be two numbers. AMG will also have two numbers, but those will all end in \"3.\" Applications include A 40, CLA 40, SLC 40, SLC 50 and GLE 50 in Canada, along with CLA 53, G73 and S73. Yes, \"73,\" which would be the new range-topper, probably with AMG's new performance\u00a0hybridpowertrain.It's important to keep two things in mind. First, Mercedes models are now specified as -Benz, -AMG and -Maybach, meaning you'd be looking at a\u00a0Mercedes-Benz\u00a0CLA 40 and Mercedes-AMG CLA 53, for instance. And second, having three numbers no longer serves a purpose since those numbers no longer correspond with engine output in any way.There's no such evidence of a similar application made in the United States, but if this is the way of the Benz future, it's hard to imagine Mercedes doing something different here (although\u00a0Audi\u00a0is doing just that).\n\n\u00a0\nDoesn't really help if you want to know what kind of engine dwells in the engine bay..\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

All the best with your decision.

After owning a current gen merc with the same auto parking system for 1yr, I never got the opportunity to use it successfully even once.... \u00a0\n\u00a0\nMainly because I can park faster than the system and I try to always park away from the crowd and walk abit further. ..\u00a0 So the criteria of being between 2 cars never really arise. And the system don't work if the lots are empty around the lot you wanted to park.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAny how, car ownership in Singapore is short, very soon you will yearn for more space to chuck your strollers amd kiddie bikes/scooters, SUV/wagons will be on your list.\u00a0 Enjoy your ride!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSignificant drop in power compare to my 525i when i test drive the C180 but wife love the car because of the auto parking system.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited March 24, 2018 by Vratenza\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

If you have specific films you want, tell your SE.\n5. C&C Pandan\n6. I don't think C&C allows own EO.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Tears starting to roll down my cheek, only slight improvement so i change the mode again to sport and sport +.. \nAh ha, finally something is happening. Thanks God there is this 2 modes. But i also realise the suspension for this car not very good.\nHi Bro, I will give u my feedback based on my experience after driving thr B180 for one year plus.\n\u00a0\n1. There are two batteries in the car. One main battery at the engine compartment and one side battery at the glove compartment area. The side battery is used for start stop purpose.\n\u00a0\n2. The start stop is always working but u can turn it off manually using a button on the center console or u programmed in individual mode and turn off the start stop function. If u leave it on, it is working unless it is not meeting certain condition and u will see it on the dashboard display with a A circle around it. There are a few conditions which will affect the start stop. I know one of them is the air con. If it is not reaching the temperature u set, the start stop will cut off. So if u always blast your air con, most likely your start stop will always cut off.\n\u00a0\n3. On your aircon setting, i have not try c180. But for my B180, i normally set to fan at 1, and temp at 22 deg and it is blowing cold air like mad. But sometime i need to set to fan at 2 to cool down fast. I thought the solar film is doing quite a good job.\n\u00a0\n4, Sound proofing, again based on my B180 it is still ok. Not so loud compared to my previous jap car.maybe the roof of B180 is also quite high compared to C class. So it might not sound so loud as your ears are futher away. Joking.\n\u00a0\n5. Jerking gear shifting at low rev is a common thing for dual clutch car. My B180 also got the same problem. Just need to get use to it. The other thing i encounter is sometime the car will just rev up suddenly and i need to jam the brake.\n\u00a0\nIf u chane to sports mode, it will drink petrol like water. That is my expereince but it is very responsive. The suspension will be harder too. But u can set to individual setting and set differrnt mode for the engine and suspension. This is what i do and csn also turn on and off the start stop to your liking.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Thx\n\u00a0\nI took 30% loan. but they didnt FOC any camera for me. when i collecting my car i asked, they say its not included..\n\u00a0\ni was slighly pissed off and didnt want to pay them for any car cam he purposed. i complained about the solar firm got bubble he told me to monitor for a week and see the bubble goes off not.... \n\u00a0\nI got the essentials package but no Nano. \nBro, car camera will void your warranty for your battery if it is not installed by cnc. Unless u using the cigarette lighter jack as the power supply. Their concern is the parking mode recording of the camera draining the battery. They said the battery is not designed to support parking mode recording. The J and S camera they provided also has the parking mode recording turned off by default. If u ask the camera suppplier to turn on the mode, once the battery drained off it eill be cover under warranty.i almost wanted to install backup battery for car camera and turn on the parking mode. Lucky i did not so it as my car battery died just after 1 year. I went to cnc and they changed out battery foc for me. If i had installed the extra battery for camera, they will claim that it is my fault. Actually, i asked them why battery will die so fast and they can tell me they already know as the factory battery came with the car got problem in the first place.\u00a0\nThen i called i everytime need to adjust the clock for the car almost every 1 or 2 months. Now with the new battery no such problem.\n\u00a0\nAs for the bubble on the solar film it is alao normal. Mine also got bubble and it will disappear after a while. \n\u00a0\nAlso dun be surpise that your car headlight will fog after a heavy downpour. It happen first time i just collected my car and it was raining so heavy. I saw condensation on the headlamp and i was like shit. Then it also go away and never happen again.\n\u00a0\nThe only complain i had for my car is the paint. The nano coating they provide is useless again scratches. The paint is very thin and this car got alot of scratches. I go outside to apply my own ceramic coating and it gives better protection.\n\nNo way the suspension will have any change unless your car is optionally equipped with airmatic.\n\u00a0\nall in the mind.\n\u00a0\n \nhehe, i might have recall wrongly, it could be the steering setting. My bad.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Mine only lasted 3 months with once per month washing. Better do ceramic or glass coating outside once exhausted the free sessions or skip it totally if you value your paint.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Here you have the option of arranging it before you collect your car, or doing the second one during the 15k servicing. It just takes some pre-emptive planning. It's always good to think ahead in life, instead of reacting to it.\n\u00a0\nA Forester or Corolla comes almost bare, and many fittings are installed locally.\u00a0\nSo if you don't want the camera / PPS / Car Essential package, you could have told your sales rep and save a few dollars too.\nIf you still don't like it, you can always opt out too. No one is forcing you to get it.\nWill I go for another PPS when my package runs out?\nMaybe, or I simply get a new coat of paint and also cover any scratches or dents at the same time. No fuss.\n\u00a0\nCheers\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited May 10, 2018 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I wanted to change it at 2 years but my workshop told me no need. AA did a check on my battery at about 3.5 years and it was still in very good condition. AA has a device that can measure the remaining life of your battery. I needed AA because my battery had gone flat after my wife sat in the car listening to music with the fan running for more than an hour without the alternator charging. I will normally measure the voltage of the battery to see if it is ok with my ZUS device.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited May 22, 2018 by andrewyewkc\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Just the usual Radio station display on and when doing reverse, the camera would come on.\nI observed that these are usually the case for most MB cars. Its such a waste and under-utilized of good gadget. \n\u00a0\nLately I saw the newspaper ad that CnC have more apps loaded to their MB cars. Was wondering if I can get mine upgraded with GPS and phone apps and how would they be charged?\n\u00a0\nThanks gurus.\nU may check with infinity Werkz if they can activate the Apple CarPlay for ur model\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

AdBlue is an additive injected into the Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) filter to reduce emissions. But Mercedes software potentially reduces the quantity of AdBlue after a set period of time, improving performance and fuel economy but increasing harmful nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions.\n\u00a0\nThe so-called \"thermal switch\" is set at a particular temperature.

And with the shift, the rpm will drop from 2++k\u00a0 to 1.6k. I guess this is where the fuel saving will come in when you are cruising at such speed and especially if you are intending to be in cruise control anyway.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI tried it for a long stretch of empty highway while on cruise control... But gave up on it once the traffic starts to build up. .... Still prefer my sports mode\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n20180614_064703-picsay.jpg\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Haha\n\u00a0\nI tend to keep to the speed limit for most part of NSHW, keeping to the left most lane is not possible if you are travelling at 110kph....because bound to have cars and lorries going at 90kph there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat leaves me taking the right most lane most of the time but have to be on constant look out for faster approaching cars in the rear view mirror.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlot of times, I do not have the opportunity to sieve left because of back to back slow vehicles in the left lane, so I will usually step on my accelerator to get ahead to filter left when safe. Lot of time the mid range in gear acceleration of the GLC250 does a pretty decent job of getting from 110kph to 150kph pretty quickly such that I am usually pulling away from the rear approaching vehicle.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause of the SUV higher ride height, suv profile tires and sports suspension, the bad road surfaces, speed regulating stripes and potholes are easily overcome without unsettling the ride much.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe 4matic with rear bias is great on the B roads leading in and out of Port Dickson/Malacca area from the NSHW.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPM me what happened above 110 on NSHW? \n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

That can make rear passengers feel like they are being jostled laterally abit more. As before, firmer and lower suspension with larger wheels helps mitigate this side effects better.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIMHO, get the 4matic with 45:55 front rear split.

No Mercedes is Low class either because of the same inflated pricing in Singapore. \n\u00a0\nHowever, there are models that are made with certain engine pairings in mind. They are engineered to be optimised for certain functions and power output to give the distinctive Mercedes Benz ride. It has a reputation to live up to. \n\u00a0\nDue to the pricing in Singapore and our strange tax laws, certain models with lower output and prices become popular here. These models make some compromises in terms of functions, power, ride comfort etc based on a slider that optimises on what is acceptable between price, badge, reputation and popularity. \n\u00a0\nThat is why I prefer to classify the models into \u201cNormal\u201d classes and \u201cCompromise\u201d classes. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\n\nThanks for the tip.\nI think when new buyers come from other cars, there is some sticker shock. $500 for a service A! $150 for an air filter?? I see such reactions, but you also notice the majority of people I see at the service centres are actually folks who are past their warranty..\n\u00a0\nOf course there are those here and in other forums who ask where to service their cars after the credits are gone, but many of my friends simply continue at those inflated prices.. \n\u00a0\nI can't say it's a bargain, and certainly when a car that's the equivalent in size of a C Class can cost 50-60k less (you can buy two Kia K3 cars for the same price), you can't say VFM when you talk about Mercs (or other such brands).\n$150 for air filter is pure over charging. Depending on model it can range from $20-$50 for most mercs. Anyway to each his own. \n\u00a0\nDifference in parts quality these days are not that much difference given global sourcing. Rarely an auto maker makes their own components. Air filter made by hengst, Mann, Mahler are all approved vendors to Daimler. \n\u00a0\nThese manufacturers also supply to other car makers worldwide. Quite some are still hesistant to use oem parts. I have seen an orig Merc air filter vs a Mann filter. The only diff is Mercedes part number printed on it.\n\u00a0\nAlso just FYI to all.C&C does not carry all the parts in their store, they just like all other stockist order from the Daimler warehouse in Singapore which also supplies parts regionally. C&C like everyone else is but a mere authorized distributor. \n\u00a0\nOrdering parts from stockist is usually cheaper and sometimes even faster that getting from C&C. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited July 29, 2018 by Mkl22\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Just opt for whatever makes sense. Some towkays can get away with no loan and yet keep their discount and service credits but I think it is very hard as the finance and insurance companies are paying real commission to these guys.\n\u00a0\nAnyway, just take min loan (don't think 60% is the bare minimum and 5 years is definitely not the shortest available tenure), prepay the loan after 1 year, lose a bit of money on 7/8 rule but overall it should still be better than forgoing all those discounts and service credits.\n\u00a0\nThere is no clawback for prepayment. I checked.\n\n\u00a0\nPML SE also told me this...take up loan then pay penalty for full settlement after that\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nHe said freebies worth more than the interest cum penalty\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nBut i dont know how true it is\u00a0 \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The multimedia software seems to have been updated and responds more quickly than my 7G.\u00a0 The sound system seems better too.\u00a0 The Thinkware cameras are user friendly as you can access the car cam videos through an app using the camera wifi.\u00a0 The camera comes with lane departure and forward collision warning systems\u00a0 but I turned it off as the camera's sensitivity is higher than the car's and I was getting lots of warning sounds which was pretty irritating after a while. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nSome follow-up details on the deal in case you may be offered similar trade-in offer.\n\u00a0\nI managed to increase my trade-in price to 151k from 150k.\u00a0 This package includes the Car Essentials Plus which adds front and rear brake pads, aircon filter and chemical wash, battery replacements on top of 4x PPS, interior wash, windscreen polish, etc..\u00a0 They threw in the integrated Garmin GPS for free. I still haven't gotten around to using it much. The good part is that it is touchscreen operated.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI requested for a waiver of early repayment penalty fee on my HP loan with MBFS since new loan is with them too, which my SE said could be done but they need to put in request before the old loan has been paid off.

The 9G certainly feels smoother during gear change.  The rest of the car is pretty much the same. The multimedia software seems to have been updated and responds more quickly than my 7G.  The sound system seems better too.  The Thinkware cameras are user friendly as you can access the car cam videos through an app using the camera wifi.  The camera comes with lane departure and forward collision warning systems  but I turned it off as the camera's sensitivity is higher than the car's and I was getting lots of warning sounds which was pretty irritating after a while.  \n\u00a0\nSome follow-up details on the deal in case you may be offered similar trade-in offer.\n\u00a0\nI managed to increase my trade-in price to 151k from 150k.

I based on min need top up and my monthly installment still lower . Just restarting a similar finance cycle. New car depre is about 21.5k based on the retail price.

Thanks for insinuating I am qualified to write an instruction manual.\n\u00a0\nLet me clarify a few of your misinformation.\n\u00a0\n1. There is no practical situation on the road to need to go one gear higher manually from full auto (D). So why would anyone want to press the + paddle shift to activate the (M) mode? Just down gear immediately already.\n\u00a0\nEdit: I have never even attempted to upshift from (D) mode, so cannot say for sure if (M) can be activate. Will try this evening and update here later.\n\u00a0\n2. Pressing and holding the + is to change from (M) to (D) mode. Nothing to do with OD (which I assume you meant over drive gear) which is the final gear in the transmission ie. 9th gear in 9Gtronic and 7th Gear in 7G-tronic. So you don't need to reach OD before you can return to (D) -full auto mode.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDats exactly the problem.At least u come true,most ppl Yaya only ,u ask them,dey will say,juzz flip ++ only,veri easy.Can u use yr own words ?Its veri easy to copy & pasteRight paddle: single tap to up shift 1 gear. double taps to upshift 2 gears and so on. The gear indicator will change from D to M (manual) and the current gear number will be shown. It stay in this mode till it times out if no further input to manually up or downshift.My take on dis PD thingy is basically for overtaking or downshift a gear or two earlier than the automatic can compute.To activate the PD,first u have to press - ,am sure u guys ve try & it dun work ,u can't juzz press + to start the PD.Also learn a few things from vratenza dat u press+and hold it 'll reach the OD faster.Anwae u need to reach OD than u can b back to auto.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited September 12, 2018 by Vratenza\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

That may be a false impression or wishful thinking on my part, and due to the complexity of today's car we may never see the pre-1990s build quality again.

Really sian by half when realised that after collected the second car, but too late already. I checked through the used B180 at sgcarmart, think the extendable front seats come in from Dec/2015. I am assuming same goes for the extra transmission mode.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut never imagine this kind of thing could happen as normally facelift means facelift, there would not be any more change however minor unless is safety related, and so soon after the facelift like in < 9months.\u00a0That would be my only grouse so far. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Besides the engine, I also had drive shaft bearings being worn out causing loud grinding noises, but thankfully it was fixed under  warranty.

I am very interested, I remember last time when I was very junior I was sitting in my boss' S-Class and I will always remember how luxurious it feels. \n\u00a0\nYes COE car may come with some (maybe a lot of) problems and the road tax goes higher, but I am just thinking with the 'low' yearly depreciation, the 'balance' will go towards changing the parts through the next 10 years. That will really fulfill a dream.\n\u00a0\nAnyone owned the S-Class generation that was around say 2009 onwards, can advise on whether the upkeep is ok or is it a problematic car?\nWhen looking at merk?*republic is a good place to start,c&c preown wing.\n\u2022try to get their vin number & check the authenticity of the mileage,add 12k for a year & do the Maths\n\u2022Request to get the car inspected for a fee,get some x'pert not\nsta or vicom\n\u2022Get the warranty spelt out in ink,try to b specific,major item minor item will b difficult to argue once issue start\n\u2022Set aside 3-4 k on TOP of the price ,to sort it all out when u collected yr vehicle,dun leave it to chance.\n\u2022research research research check forum,ask valid question?\nI stop buying new,(if u dun need to entertain overseas client)dats lots of gem to b found.\nS class main issue is the airmatic.\nGo to Accord in Bukit Merah,dey got a kit to repair it,nobody does it,as far as I noe.\nGood luck.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I was told that it is due to the storage full and overwriting of the files that caused it to have error. When u hear the beeping sound, u will see that the camera red LED indicator will go off. And the next time u hear the beep, it will light up again, indicating that it has restarted. \n\u00a0\nYou have to go to www.thetomogroup.com to download their Logon PC Viewer (which has only the PC version). I have to use my old PC laptop with a SD card reader to load it and format the card as my current laptops are Mac.\n\u00a0\nFor me, after formatting the MicroSD card and then reinserting back in, the problem will be gone. However, u got to do it every 1-2 months when it happens again. Remember to back up any footages that are important before formatting.\n\u00a0\nYou can drop a mail to Matthew if you want to find out more or need further clarification at: matthew.ng@tomocse.com.sg\n\u00a0\nHope this helps.

Overtrade $10,000 ($6,000 + $4,000 early bird promo)\n2. Service credits $8,000\n3. Solar Film\n4. Front and back recording camera (Logon T8)\n5. C/E package plus\n6. Floor mats/boot storage tray\n7. Star collection 12x\n\u00a0\nI will be getting the vehicle next month. I might be the first few batches, if not the first batch to own a facelifted C&C C200 coupe on the streets! Thanks to my sales agent for the following up, making the arrangements and booking to get the deals done.\nI've met a lot of agent before this and were reluctant to entertain me because of all the hassle, they rather sell ready available or otw shipments.\n\u00a0\nShe was really helpful and test drove many times on the previous models. On the day of signing, she even gives me more than 30mins of test drive in the new C200 sedan, showing me all the new figures, test the new drive train (can't feel any turbo lag!) etc....\u00a0 most sales won't be bothered I guess as it's already a done deal.\n\u00a0\nOverall its a pleasant experience, although its a long wait (more than 1yr!) but it definitely worth it!\n\u00a0\nIf anyone wishes to get to know my agent, pm me.\n\n\u00a0\ni have share my thoughts in the C class chat and i think members should have another point of view\n\u00a0\nthis post is definitely written by a\u00a0SE (Sale Executive , or a complete Newbie whose name is Robert that kena Carrot)\n\u00a0\nsimple, cos the post left out a few key factors\n\u00a0\n1) Firstly the promo Pohtk received is very standard nothing special at all to be honest,\nanyone walk in the doors of Cycle will receive the same package\u00a0\n\u00a0\nthe Merc Festiva (22-24 Mar) also offer 12K OT, 6K Service Credits & COE Rebate at 39K , option 2-7 (is standard)\n\u00a0\n2) what is missing is that, Pohtk did not mention (assume that he does not know ) is the trade in price\n\u00a0\nhe has to sell a car to enjoy OT, what was he driving prior? what is the price quoted by RA ?\nwas it a \"fair price\"?\n\u00a0\nthe trade in price after the SE / Republic Auto can be Neg again, (if you do your homework and know the actual sale price, but lets be fair to Republic auto they do need to make 2-3K off your ride for admin charges, etc)\n\u00a0\n3) there is actually a \"commission per car\" from the SE (which i know but i cannot say, due to NDA), dun believe the SE cock story, i only earn $500 - $1000 from the sale.

Surely you should and ask for discounts but IF the agent says no, you can surely walk off or just take as it is. If you try to goto Mercs showroom now, they very \"ya ya\" ... their cars sells itself.

If the problem is still unsolve after a while, you have at least two ways, others may be able to suggest more:\n1. tell them you have given them sufficient time, since they are unable to resolve their product problem, they should give you a very attractive goodwill discount if their proposition is for you to get a new car.\n2. worst case, get a trade-in deal with republic auto(their used car division) for a used car that is of the same age, at a very good discount. I am not sure if the could do that and you may have to open up your option to take a different model .\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Will give them one more chance this weekend as they promise to give me an answer by Monday. otherwise, see me in the showroom next weekend.\n\u00a0\nto some other questions:\n1) I didn't install anything additional by myself. Dashcam was preinstalled by sales before I take delivery of the car.\n2) I drive to work daily, so it's not a case of battery dying from none movement of car.\n3) this is not the only problem with my car. earlier issues were resolved, though also only after showing hard evidence that the car's problems were not normal. didn't blow it up as the car was still road worthy. \n4) car was purchase at above $210k and new car of same model around $240k Thus with straight line depreciation, I still need to top up around $50k for almost exactly the same car (there is recent facelift). \n5) I did ask for a second hand car of same model and condition for 1 for 1 exchange but they said impossible to find because of the facelift, so I have to pay more to change the car.\n6) some of you may say that it's fair that I top up for a facelift model with higher COE, but in the first place, I won't want to change my car for almost exactly the same model, 1 year younger, if I have to top up $50k. Even if I buy a new car elsewhere, I will already suffer higher COE. So why should I be the only one suffering losses while C&C still make profit from selling the 2nd car to me? For the same model, PI is more than $20k cheaper too.\n7) To reiterate, the car has been with C&C for 3 weeks already, they were supposed to return it to me after 2 weeks of monitoring (as the battery died without warning twice, only the 3rd failure had pre-warning), but only notice some abnormality at the end of the 2 weeks, so requested for another 1.5 weeks extension to further monitor. Software has been reloaded, but honestly, they are still unable to pin down the cause. Thus unable to claim that problem has been resolved. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But at the same time, I do not think it is a common issue over here as Mercedes batteries are famous for being long lasting and never hear much at all about its cars having electrical issues, lets not cast stones and make it like many Mercedes over here is all like that haha.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

They have to settle it \"nicely\", much like other luxury brands which have had issues in China.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIn addition to our small mkt, I think the problem in SG is also there is only 1 main authorized dealer for each car brand, unlike teleco, insurance, etc. Even though there are PIs, these are not exactly similar competition. \n\u00a0\nIt is not exactly a level playing field for us consumers, sorry but to put it bluntly - what options do we have & what can we do if we want to buy Mercedes from an AD ?\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\nYou will be surprised if you try it.\u00a0 Park your car in front of C&C.\u00a0 Put a huge cardboard that says \"This is a lemon car\".\n\u00a0\nSomeone will pick it up and goes to STOMP.\n\u00a0\nRem Monica Baey.\u00a0 If she didn't sound out through Social Media Network, would the world know?\n\u00a0\nFor telco and insurer, there are just too many of them in such a small market.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

They told me listed new car price, so that's even before whatever overtrade, financing offer that they usually give to customers. Not forgetting their fat margin. Their reason being that if I sell the car in the market, i will fetch lower price than straight line depreciation. In the first place, I wouldn't have to get rid of the car if it is not a lemon. They also refused to give me their proposed numbers in black and white but only verbally. \n\u00a0\nTo your knowledge regarding their service menu, they had indeed pulled out one item at a time to check voltage. They had completed that and still couldn't identify the problem. Now they have installed some tracker and request to keep my car for another week, ie, 4 weeks in total. All these with no compensation, only a replacement car that's older than my car. So I still have not gotten my car back after 3 weeks.\nSorry to hear of your predicament.

What I mean is TS  does not have a case to bring C&C  to court for now. What he could do is to continue to negotiate with them for a middle ground deal , and meantime hope that the problem can be resolved soon.  If they could find the cause and get it fixed, the car should still be considered in good working condition.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 2 by Ct3833\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But because consumers are always at the disadvantage ends, my concerns is if you raise your case to the court to early,\u00a0 you may end up spending money and energy with little win odds. Even if you bring them to court,\u00a0 likelihood they will say they are committed to solve your problem but you did not give them sufficient time, which is\u00a0 very subjective.\u00a0 \u00a0I have also\u00a0 said right from the beginning that 50k is too much, I am sure they could do better than that.\n\u00a0I think CASE at best would help you write a letter, there is nothing much they could do about it. But glad to know that you have lawyer willing to\u00a0 take up the case up against C&C, just have to be prepared to spend time, money and energy to deal with them.\nThe best case out would be for them to solve your problem quickly, or alternatively, they could give you a new car at very good price so that you suffer limited loss, maybe equivalent to one year linear net depre of your current car or less.\u00a0 Be rest assured that I am not supportive of the bully attitude of Cycle.

It's one of the FOCS chaps. And he definitely has deep pockets. The \"trick\" that the big players engage in is to keep getting the case continued so the plaintiff becomes very deeply in the hole with regard to legal fees. It's kind of a Catch-22, because a cheaper law firm may not be willing to take on a prominent AD and their high priced lawyers in the first place. So any plaintiff would be forced to engage a highly reputable law firm. And you can imagine how the fees would mount up when things keep getting delayed.\n\u00a0\nI'd say 50k is the *lower* limit of what one can expect to shell out without hope of recovery (and still without any guarantee of success). \n\u00a0\nI hope no one mistakes my sincere realism as my being against @Lipingasia or on the side of the big players here, I'm clearly not. But the system is rigged in a sense.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 3 by Turboflat4\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Even if they could fix your problem, they should extend your warranty and give you some service credit.\nMy earlier concerns of you bringing them to court too early was because you may end up spending unnecessary money and effort for nothing.\u00a0 Large corporation like them has a team of lawyers and legal counsel, and they will engage their regular experience lawyers\u00a0 externally. While this might be your first case,\u00a0 they are seasoned with such matters, so one needs to be well prepared before facing them in a court room.\n\nYes, I wanted to mention this but didn't want to dampen his enthusiasm or quench his hope.\n\u00a0\nI think you know which guy I'm referring to with regard to the E55 lemon case. It's one of the FOCS chaps. And he definitely has deep pockets. The \"trick\" that the big players engage in is to keep getting the case continued so the plaintiff becomes very deeply in the hole with regard to legal fees. It's kind of a Catch-22, because a cheaper law firm may not be willing to take on a prominent AD and their high priced lawyers in the first place. So any plaintiff would be forced to engage a highly reputable law firm. And you can imagine how the fees would mount up when things keep getting delayed.\n\u00a0\nI'd say 50k is the *lower* limit of what one can expect to shell out without hope of recovery (and still without any guarantee of success).\n\u00a0\nI hope no one mistakes my sincere realism as my being against @Lipingasia or on the side of the big players here, I'm clearly not. But the system is rigged in a sense.\n\nthis is my fear for TS too. We small consumers always get bullied by big players like them.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

So they can only spin profit off servicing, parts and loan commission.\n\u00a0\nThis is exactly why in US they have the dealer union strongly objecting to direct sales by car brands (just look at the war between Tesla and the dealer union).\n\u00a0\nDun forget the trade in car.

Do not try to inflate the tyre further. Meantime, drive at a slower speed, especially when cornering, be extra careful. And remember, in case the tyre burst for whatever reason, steer your car safely to the road side, do not panic and step hard on your brake.It depends on the size of your tyres, not necessarily  your front pressure exceed limit, refer to your tyre pressure guide. And it looks like you are having a front wheel drive car, usually the front wheel drive cars have a higher tyre pressure in front.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited July 13 by Ct3833\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

If your Merc is newer ones, mine is 2015, it should come with this feature that allows you to see your tyre pressure through dashboard display.

Remember that it's in the interests of any workshop or parts supplier to agree with you if you start worrying about whether this or that needs to be changed. As an example, I had my M5's DCT fluid changed for piece of mind, even though it's supposed to be a \"lifetime\" component according to the AD and BMW themselves. But online forums and pro mechs and worried M car owners in Singapore were all in agreement that it's a \"better safe than sorry\" sort of thing. The 3rd party workshop never argued with me, they were quite happy to do it, and they did a proper job, no complaints.

If it died soon thereafter, no biggie, if the replacement cost close to a grand, you wouldn't have saved much doing it with the tyre change anyway, so what did you lose? And it might have surprised you. Basic mantra: don't try to fix what ain't broken, especially for a non-critical non-wear part.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAnd if you think these bills are \"atas\", I don't want to scare you with the preventive maintenance I pay for my current car lol.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Just another thing to pay for.\n\n\n\n\tI do not like run flat tyres option as noisier.\u00a0 Worse czse would be installing 3rd party TPMS system with internal sensors and\u00a0separate display unit, which will cost not more than $300. Only drawback is need to change batteries every 2 to 3 years. TPMS with external sensors are even much cheaper and can do it yourself, as done for previous Vellfire. Wait and see lah.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

With 75k km servicing I am assuming service credits of 6-8k?\u00a0 Plus the PPS, battery, brakes, aircon wash, fuel vouchers, etc., that is about another 5k. Then 2k for the iPhone so total about 13-15k, which brings your net cost to 144-146k?\u00a0 Seems like an ok deal considering it is from AD. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tI don't normally factor in value to solar film, cameras, welcome pack, etc. That's pretty standard with every car if you take the loan with them. Which brings up the other key point which is how long is the loan and how much is the downpayment as that adds to your effective cost.\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tCongrats!\u00a0 You will enjoy the change in ride quality from your Vezel to A200. \u00a0\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tHmm, I did a rough calculation again, given 75,000km servicing based on 15,000km intervals, that be 5 x servicing. Estimated 3 x minor ($500) and 2 x major ($1,500) that be $4,500. Close to 5k servicing credits. Any Merc owners can confirm how many major serving would be\u00a0in the range of 75,000km?\n\n\n\n\tThen again, bro Chrislancer got a iPhone 11 Pro max at $2,039 retail, the car essentials are 2k, his effective price would be about 150k?\n\n\n\n\tThe price for their Cat B cars increased 5k after the 4k+ COE increased in last week's bidding.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited Sunday at 11:36  PM by Wormee\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
