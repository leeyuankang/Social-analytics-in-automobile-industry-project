This success has encouraged us to further expand our portfolio and place it on a broader footing,\" says Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG.\nAt the heart of the A35 4Matic is a revised version of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s M260 engine, as used by the A250. It is described by AMG as a new development, although the new four-cylinder unit shares its 83.0mm bore and 92.0mm stroke measurements and design of its die-cast aluminium crankcase with the M133 engine of the A45 4Matic.\nKey engineering attributes of the AMG tweaked powerplant include uniquely-tuned twin-scroll turbochargers with reduced back pressure, \u00a0reprogrammed Camtronic variable valve control, special liners that contribute to conically shaped cylinders and a bespoke exhaust system with an automatically controlled flap that modulates the exhaust note depending on the driving mode.\nWith 302bhp at 5800rpm and 295lb ft of torque between 3000 and 4000rpm, the transversely-mounted engine delivers 81bhp and 77lb ft more than the less heavily tuned version of the M260 unit used by the A250 but 74bhp and 55lb ft less than the more highly strung M133 engine used by the A45 4Matic.\nAt the heart of the A35 4Matic is a revised version of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s M260 engine, as used by the A250.

It boasts variable distribution of drive, from front-wheel drive only to a 50:50 apportioning to the front and rear axles, via an electro-mechanically operated multi-plate clutch integrated into the rear axle assembly.\nThe driver is able to choose between five different driving modes via an AMG Dynamic Select controller, including Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual. The Slippery mode, a new development that is also planned to appear on the new A45 when it is launched in 2019, is programmed for wet road conditions, with reduced power and torque and earlier upshifts in automatic mode.\u00a0\nAlso new is a so-called \u201cgliding\u201d function. It allows the driver to choose between \u201creduced and \u201cmoderate\u201d settings for differing engine braking characteristics while coasting on a trailing throttle within the Individual driving mode.\nWith the Sport+ mode and Race Start function engaged, the A35 4Matic is claimed to accelerate from 0-to-62mph in 4.7sec and reach a top speed limited to 155mph. Combined cycle consumption is put at 38.7mpg, equating to average CO2 emissions of 167g/km on the recently superseded NEDC (New European Driving Cycle).\u00a0\nThis gives the A35 4Matic a slight edge over the M140i and S3, which are claimed to accelerate to 62mph in 4.8sec and 5.3sec respectively, in outright straight-line performance.\u00a0\nTo cope with the added performance potential brought on the A35 4Matic\u2019s new drivetrain, Mercedes-AMG has stiffened the bodyshell of the A-class hatchback upon which it is based with the addition of a so-called \u201cshear panel\u201d underneath the engine. The aluminium structure is bolted to the existing steel body shell and, in combination with two additional diagonal braces, is claimed to provide added torsional stiffness to the front end.\nThe stiffened body structure supports a MacPherson strut front suspension. It uses a newly developed aluminium carrier and radially bolted steering knuckle that AMG claims reduces the unsprung masses and provides more sensitive response to the system used by the A45 4Matic. The rear suspension is based around the four-link system used by upper range A-class models, with three transverse arms and the trailing arm, the wheel carrier and bearings shared with those of the A45 4Matic.\u00a0\nPassive dampers are standard, though buyers can option the new entry-level AMG model with an adaptive damping system that provides three different levels of stiffness. The electro-mechanical steering uses variable assistance and a more rigid mounting than the system used by other new A-class models. The brakes, meanwhile, use four-piston monoblock callipers and 350mm vented and perforated discs up front and single piston callipers and 330mm discs at the rear.\u00a0\nThe A35 4Matic builds on the sharpened appearance of the fourth-generation A-class with a unique grille, more heavily structured front bumper, standard 18-inch alloy wheels, wider sills, bold tailgate-mounted spoiler and a new rear bumper featuring a prominent diffuser element bookmarked each side by blackened round tailpipes.\nInside, the standard A-class interior has been reworked with unique upholstery for the seats an AMG steering wheel with touch-pad controls and AMG specific graphics for the digital instruments, including a so-called Supersport mode with a large central round rev counter.\nOther new features include AMG Track Pace as part of the MBUX infotainment system. It permanently records data during track driving, enabling the driver to analyse a range of information including acceleration, braking and lap times.\u00a0\nFollowing its appearance on the new fourth-generation A-class hatchback, the new 35 badge is also planned to grace successor models to the CLA, CLA Shooting Brake, GLA as well as the newly-unveiled A-class saloon and upcoming GLB compact SUV, in a move that will provide a new six-model strong entry-level range for Mercedes-Benz\u2019s performance sub-brand.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

This success has encouraged us to further expand our portfolio and place it on a broader footing,\" says Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG.\nAt the heart of the A35 4Matic is a revised version of Mercedes-Benz\u00e2s M260 engine, as used by the A250. It is described by AMG as a new development, although the new four-cylinder unit shares its 83.0mm bore and 92.0mm stroke measurements and design of its die-cast aluminium crankcase with the M133 engine of the A45 4Matic.\nKey engineering attributes of the AMG tweaked powerplant include uniquely-tuned twin-scroll turbochargers with reduced back pressure,  reprogrammed Camtronic variable valve control, special liners that contribute to conically shaped cylinders and a bespoke exhaust system with an automatically controlled flap that modulates the exhaust note depending on the driving mode.\nWith 302bhp at 5800rpm and 295lb ft of torque between 3000 and 4000rpm, the transversely-mounted engine delivers 81bhp and 77lb ft more than the less heavily tuned version of the M260 unit used by the A250 but 74bhp and 55lb ft less than the more highly strung M133 engine used by the A45 4Matic.\nAt the heart of the A35 4Matic is a revised version of Mercedes-Benz\u00e2s M260 engine, as used by the A250.

It boasts variable distribution of drive, from front-wheel drive only to a 50:50 apportioning to the front and rear axles, via an electro-mechanically operated multi-plate clutch integrated into the rear axle assembly.\nThe driver is able to choose between five different driving modes via an AMG Dynamic Select controller, including Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual. The Slippery mode, a new development that is also planned to appear on the new A45 when it is launched in 2019, is programmed for wet road conditions, with reduced power and torque and earlier upshifts in automatic mode. \nAlso new is a so-called \u00e2gliding\u00e2 function.

While the new CLA is likely to be closer dimensionally, for comparison\u2019s sake the current version of that car is 3.2 inches longer than the 2019 A-class sedan, yet the latter offers greater interior room.\n\u00a0\nThe US version's A220 sedan peaks at 188 horses and 221 lb-ft from its turbocharged 2.0-liter inline-four, versus 208 horsepower and 258 lb-ft for today\u2019s CLA250.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.caranddriver.com/news/2019-mercedes-benz-a-class-sedan-the-first-of-a-new-generation-of-baby-benzes-official-photos-and-info\n\nMercedes has confirmed that the A-Class saloon will be offered with just two engines when it goes on sale, although further units are planned once production is ramped up.\n\u00a0\nThe launch options are a\u00a0turbocharged\u00a01.3-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with 161bhp and 184lb ft (badged A200) and a 1.5-litre four-cylinder diesel with 114bhp and 192lb ft (badged A180d).\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-mercedes-benz-class-saloon-rival-four-door-audi-a3\n\n\u00a0\nThe interior is just super nice and techie.

The 'base' model will produce 387PS (382bhp), while the flagship S variant makes 421PS (415bhp). Both will put their power down through all four-wheels, and are set to go on sale later this year.\nThe output of the standard model is already in excess of the 370bhp produced by the outgoing A45, with the top-spec car a full 45bhp more powerful. That should translate to\u00a00-62mph of around four-seconds, and possibly less.\nThe video, which the German firm has called 'Not another Christmas video', showed\u00a0an A45 in a bold multi-coloured disguise livery lapping a test track in Germany, and showed\u00a0the car performing a series of powerslides.\n\u00a0\nhttps://youtu.be/1wEHAiRu99c\nWhile few official details of the range-topping A-Class have been revealed, Autocar has previously learned that it is set to have the highest specific output for a production engine in the world, eclipsing even the\u00a0McLaren Senna's 789bhp V8.\nAMG boss Tobias Moers told Autocar earlier this year that the A45 will get \"well over 400bhp\" from its\u00a0new engine, which is expected to be an extensively re-engineered version of the current car's 2.0-litre unit.\nThat means it will have\u00a0more than 200bhp per litre, ranking the car at least 12bhp-per-litre higher than the current A45 and\u00a0beating the current specific output champion, the 197bhp-per-litre\u00a0Senna.\nThe model, dubbed by AMG insiders as 'The Predator' as a nod to its extreme performance, is expected to serve a rival to Audi Sport's\u00a0RS3\u00a0in the pairing's ongoing\u00a0super-hatch fight, while also ensuring the A45 offers stronger straight-line performance than the forthcoming\u00a0BMW M2 CSL.\n\u00a0\n\nDespite rumours to the contrary, the model will be pure petrol\u00a0and will not require\u00a0a hybrid set-up to produce its headline-grabbing numbers. \"It's going to be the next step in every perspective, including driving dynamics,\" said\u00a0Moers.\nThe A45's big power advantage will be illustrated with only small aesthetic differences. It will have a quad oval-exit exhaust system, whereas the A35 will get a dual-exit system.\nAlso featured on the A45 is\u00a0AMG'\u00a0Panamericana front grille, giving the 2019 car a design nod to the recently\u00a0revealed\u00a0GT 4-door\u00a0Coup\u00e9.\nThe A45 will have its\u00a0own unique chassis developments with optional adjustable damping offering an extreme mode for high-speed circuit running.\nThe current A45 is renowned for its stiff adjustable set-up, but the recently sighted test cars for the next-gen model look to be sitting lower, suggesting\u00a0AMG could be targeting\u00a0even more body composure for track-day driving in its future model.\nThe new A-Class is 10mm longer than today\u2019s car and adopts a new floorpan and body structure that are claimed to provide significant increases in rigidity. This provides it with improved refinement.\nThe new A45 will also get a significantly wider front track and receive its own unique wheel carriers in a bid to reduce unsprung mass. It will roll on standard 18in wheels, but 19in rims will be an option.\nThe basis for the changes to the M133 engine unit comes from Mercedes\u2019 new M260 four-cylinder engine. This is derived from the older M270 motor used by today\u2019s\u00a0A-Class\u00a0but has a new crankcase and cylinder head.\nInitially, the reworked M133 will feature a traditional exhaust gas-driven twin-scroll turbocharger. However, AMG is also developing a more advanced variant of its new engine that uses a 48V electrical system and runs both an electric-driven turbocharger and electric motor in a hybrid set-up that promises an even greater ramp-up in performance.\nAMG is also looking to endow its new hatchback model with an extra 20lb ft \u2014 a move that, insiders have told Autocar, will provide it with at least 369lb ft and allow its 0-62mph sprint\u00a0to crack the 4.0sec mark.\n\nrefinement.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new A45 will also get a significantly wider front track and receive its own unique wheel carriers in a bid to reduce unsprung mass.

Both have been extensively redesigned to handle the higher torque loadings of the new model.\nIn line with developments further down the new\u00a0A-Class\u00a0line-up, AMG\u2019s new flagship hatchback model is set to adopt a new nine-speed dual-clutch transmission, together with a faster-reacting four-wheel-drive system that offers greater variability in the drive split between the front and rear wheels, plus a torque vectoring function for added on-the-limit handling delicacy.\nThe new\u00a0A-Class, which is codenamed W177, will have the most comprehensive AMG range thanks to the introduction of the\u00a0Golf R\u00a0and\u00a0Ford Focus RS-rivalling\u00a0A35, which was revealed\u00a0at\u00a0Paris motor show. That car\u00a0faces BMW's next 1 Series hot hatch, which is set to adopt\u00a0all-wheel drive and be called the M130iX.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve identified a market for a milder AMG model positioned below the A45 4Matic,\u201d AMG boss Tobias Moers told Autocar. \u201cThe strategy is going to be similar to that seen further up the line-up, where our various 43\u00a0models support the 63\u00a0models.\u201d\nThe new A45 builds on the developments of the new\u00a0fourth-generation A-Class. The model is the first of up to eight new compact cars, which include replacements for today\u2019s B-Class, CLA and CLA Shooting Brake, as well as the GLA. There will also be\u00a0an\u00a0A-Class Saloon\u00a0(and its own 400bhp A45 variant), a\u00a0GLB\u00a0and a possible new seven-seat version of the GLB.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

This is a Mercedes specification, not C&C requirement.\u00a0 Even after your free servicing is over, C&C would still maintain the same position. Of course only if a car did not clock more than 15k km distance, then the servicing is one year interval. This is also recorded in the onboard computer. If you scroll through\u00a0 the service menu on the display, you should be able to see your next servicing mileage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

So it's really up to you.\u00a0\nA180 and A200 both 150ish. I'm sure you can negotiate with them.\u00a0\nPIs generally bring in the UK model, which is the Premium, Premium Plus or AMG line.\u00a0\nC&C ones come with slightly bigger rims and run flat tires, electric adjustable seats, folding mirrors etc. PI one is manual seats, if you go for the higher model got heated seats... but not worth it in Singapore. Also do take into consideration trade in value etc, or wait for promo\n\u00a0\nWho are the PI selling it and best price to buy from? How much is C&C selling?\n\nyou bought it from C&C? How much?\n\u00a0\nI heard that PI spec is higher? How many free servicing from C&C?\n\u00a0\nServicing C&C will give you enough to cover for 3 years. PIs will give about 6 servicing. But for PIs, when you get the car and hit 1000 km, they will generally ask you to bring in, whereas C&C it's 15,000km or one year. Do also consider the warranty and what is covered/not covered.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes, I will put my 4577 number plate on IT...

The price difference may be 20K or so, but really... if you want to test drive, C&C is probably the place to do it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u200bMaybe I am too used to AML used car or buying Japanese cars all my life.

PI cars come with Mercedes UK maps pre-installed - to my knowledge there is no way to change this to Mercedes SEA maps as of now.\n\u00a0\nMOST PI W177 can have carplay/andriod auto added on. This means that you can have google maps/waze on the screen.\n\u00a0\nTherefore you should just get carplay/andriod auto and forget about the Mercedes maps.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

You can use it to offset the retail price of the car, and pay for your own servicing. 2. Use it to deduct servicing including wear and tear parts. Even if you sell your Merc, you are allowed to use the remaining credits to buy merchandise. You can even bring forward to use on your next Merc if you trade-in for a new car. The 5k literally is credit that belongs to you, not C&C.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tService interval by C&C is 15K or 12 months\u00a0(similar to other VAG cars) while some PIs insisted 10k intervals (mentioned in other treads).

To Daimler, PI Merc owners are second owner already. So do note the support from PI and their counterpart agent\u00a0for recall on technical issues. I have a friend who bought his Vezel from a very reputable PI in 2014/5 period. The PI is still selling cars like hot cakes till now. Remember the Vezel BBC that catches fire and was made a big hooha for recall till LTA, my friend till now haven't get his BBC replaced hor.

Car is usually registered to the exporting company but moved by tow trucks as exporters wouldn't want to drive it themselves and incur potential damages. But if you think that makes the first buyer here a second buyer then you are technically right of course. But most importantly, car qualifies as new here. With regards to the car being driven from factory to port - nope. But port to dealership - yes, a small chance depending on the exporter that PIs use but trust me, majority don't use such exporters. In fact under the \"recommended pi\" thread, there was such a case which the owner complained about.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAs for agent support, its about \"you never buy from me why should I help you? But you pay me adoption fees then sure i can take care of it\". That is the agent's decision and not cos it's a second hand car. An example - if you import in a VW or a Skoda, you get the VW/Skoda 2 years warranty without any adoption fees as they are not represented by any agent (err for now). You pay for servicing but your repairs etc are under warranty.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tRecalls - fully agree with you and what you described with the vezel is a real problem. PI do have the option to bring in the part themselves to fix it but it's cost to them which to me is unethical and i hope more can be done regarding that.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tThe warranty providers that i use follow factor oil change intervals and it heavily depends on who is your warranty provider. Free servicings can be negotiated with your PI before you purchase but should the ws get you to anyhow go for unnecessary oil change, remember to just refer to the user manual.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited September 17 by jlote\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

If cycle can sell it to you for 140k with all your freebies or discounts etc, then why would PIs even want to be bringing the models into Singapore? Yes i have been to cycle re the A and as a matter of fact, i had bought 2 vehicles from them before and that's the reason why i didn't want to buy my 3rd vehicle from them. Cost and specs aside, encountered a few problems with them (other owners too, in fact the threads on merc explain some of the problems of cycle, feel free to browse the merc threads here) , so decided to get my unit from a PI.

Listed price $161,888 til 10 Oct. however used car quoted similar to another PI, TTS Eurocars.

Just not the GPS.\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tAs to how to choose PI got no right no wrong, need to make sure the warranty/servicing/COE terms/and T&C are explained clearly to you. Best is try to go for the better ones like Vincar, Meyer Motors, Emperor Motors, etc. These days got new PI popping out every other week, if you ask me it would be\u00a0risky to just go for cheapest.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tYou are right there. As a smaller pi myself, i understand customers' concerns clearly thanks to the few rotten apples in the industry. Nevertheless if you go ahead and get from other pi except the above (who imo are one of the best and most professional ones out there, in fact nearly bought a car from one of them before long way i even entered this industry ) do make sure you see the vac papers to ensure it's a ready stock. Also, read the t&c carefully and insist on adding in clauses (if not present) that are going to safeguard you as a buyer. Even some old and big ones try unethical tactics but im sure none of the above ones that you mentioned. Smaller pi sometimes can give better prices due to low operating costs as well. But always insist on documentation rather than relying on words.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\u00a0\n\n\n\n\tAnd yes android auto can be done.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
