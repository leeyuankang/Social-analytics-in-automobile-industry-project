It\u2019s set to go on sale in 2019, slotting nicely in between the GLA and GLC and based on the same underpinnings as the 2018 A-Class. It is also dubbed as a Baby G Wagon, as it boxy design is meant to create more interior space than the GLA.\n\u00a0\nUnderpinning the GLB will be the same MFA2 architecture as the GLA. Despite the common platform, the GLB will be slightly larger than the GLA and can be expected to adopt some exterior styling inspiration from the all-new generation A-Class.\n\u00a0\nIn the cabin, our sources tell us that the GLB will be quite similar to the A-Class as well. Consequently, the new MBUX infotainment system of the small hatchback will make an appearance in the SUV. The similarities between the A-Class and GLB won\u2019t stop here.\n\u00a0\nAs a matter of fact, various A-Class engines are on the cards, including a selection of hybrid and plug-in hybrid units.\n\u00a0\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLB is tipped to arrive by the end of 2019 before landing in showrooms in 2020.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe CGI look very interesting, BUT please bear in mind this is NOT the real thing yet...\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited March 14, 2018 by Carbon82\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

While she wouldn\u2019t reveal whether the seven-seat model would be a crossover or an MPV to battle the BMW 2-Series Gran Tourer, many are expecting a seven-seat version of the GLB. This makes sense as crossovers are significantly more popular than MPVs and they sell well in a variety of markets.\n\u00a0\nWhatever form the seven-seat model takes, it will be one of nine compact models from Mercedes-Benz. The company hasn\u2019t revealed all of the upcoming vehicles but the list will include the A-Class sedan and hatchback, the redesigned CLA and a new GLA. There will also be the B-Class and the all-new GLB.\n\u00a0\nBesides talking about the upcoming family of compact vehicles, Seeger confirmed the next-generation S-Class will become the company\u2019s first model to offer a Level 3 semi-autonomous driving system. She also said the company is \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with its diesel engines and their sales.\n\u00a0\nWhile diesel vehicles will remain in the company\u2019s lineup, Seeger said approximately 15-25% of the company\u2019s products will be electrified by 2025. The exact product mix remains to be seen as Seeger said \u201cTime and consumers will tell us which percentage will be full-electric, plug-in hybrid, 48-volt hybrid, gasoline and diesel.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But going by EU6 requirement, I can safely said that the newer mild hybrid setup for entry level MB should land the car in at least the Neutral band, when it is launched sometime towrads end of the year.

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nMercedes-Benz Concept GLB\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nWith the Concept GLB at the 2019 Auto Shanghai, Mercedes-Benz shows what SUV ideas on the company's compact car platform might also be realised alongside the GLA as a sporty all-rounder. While the latter promises progressive driving enjoyment with its coup\u00e9-like lines, the Concept GLB places the emphasis on spaciousness and robustness. The concept car (length/width/height: 4634/1890/1900 millimetres) has space for up to seven occupants thanks to its long wheelbase (2829 millimetres). A number of sturdy features signal that the Concept GLB feels right at home on rough farm tracks.\n\u00a0\n\"We asked ourselves whether there is still space between the GLA and GLC in our successful SUV range. The Concept GLB is the answer to this question. With it we are demonstrating the creative ideas we have for this segment, too\", says Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Sales. \"The Concept GLB is a durable and practical SUV with nonetheless compact dimensions. Whether it is a generous, seven-seater family vehicle or a versatile leisure time companion: we are certain that this concept will be of great interest to our customers.\" Customers highly appreciate the varied SUV portfolio of Mercedes-Benz. To date, more than six million customers worldwide have purchased a Mercedes-Benz SUV. In 2018, with more than 820,000 units sold, the SUVs were the strongest segment for Mercedes-Benz.\n\u00a0\n\nSUV genes skilfully brought to the fore: Exterior design\n\u00a0\nThe Mercedes-Benz Concept GLB has a distinctive presence in the world of compact SUVs with its muscular proportions. The clear, surface-accentuated contours with reduced lines and precise joints convey effortless superiority and modernity. The upright front section with its striking MULTIBEAM LED headlamps is clear evidence of off-road genes, as are the short overhangs at the front and rear. The long wheelbase and the functional greenhouse are the decisive factors providing generous spaciousness for up to seven occupants.\n\u00a0\nThe muscular and sensuously contoured vehicle shoulder dominates the side view, an effect reinforced by the rising waistline. The contiguous doors improve ease of access and keep the door apertures free of soiling. All-round protective claddings divide the overall proportions and emphasise the vehicle's off-road character.\n\u00a0\nThe harmonious colour concept has exterior paintwork in designo cashmere white magno with high-gloss black mounted parts (e.g. the claddings or integrated roof box) as a contrast, plus discreet orange highlights in the radiator grille and as lettering on the outside mirror housings.\n\u00a0\nThe chrome underguard at the front with integral air inlets in a stainless steel look emphasises the off-road qualities. The rear underguard echoes this theme, creating a balanced overall picture.\n\u00a0\nExtra show car elements: equipped for expeditions\n\u00a0\nWith a series of distinctive extra elements the concept vehicle exhibits a particularly robust character. At the front and rear, two shrouds emerge from the roof frame and accommodate LED spotlights acting as ambient lighting and orientation aids when driving off-road.\n\u00a0\nThe black roof rails end in a curve at the front and rear. A roof box is mounted on the rear area. The rough-treaded off-road tyres are on robust 17-inch wheels in a bicolour design.\n\u00a0\nHigh-quality finish and very spacious: the interior\n\u00a0\nIn design terms the interior of the Concept GLB reveals its membership of the new Mercedes-Benz compact car family, but as a showcar and SUV it has a special leather features and special trim elements. And for the first time in a compact model by Mercedes-Benz, a third seat row with two additional single seats that can be recessed flush into the load compartment floor to increase load capacity. These seats are far more than emergency seats, and offer comfortable seating for two medium-sized occupants.\n\u00a0\nMake space: flexible seat arrangement in the second and third row\n\u00a0\nThe backrest of the middle seat row is 40:20:40 split-folding, and can be folded down to create a level load surface. The seat surfaces have a 40:60 division. The second seat row is fore-and-aft adjustable by 140 mm - by 90 mm to the front to increase luggage space or legroom for occupants right in the rear, and by 50 mm to the rear if particularly generous legroom is required in a five-seat configuration. Eight-stage seat backrest inclination adjustment in the second seat row also facilitates adaptation according to the current space or comfort requirements.\n\u00a0\nTo facilitate access to the third seat row, the seats in the second row have an Easy-Entry function: when the unlocking lever on the top outer edge of the backrest is operated, the backrest folds forward and the entire seat can be pushed forward. A total of four child seats can be attached in the second and third seat rows.\n\u00a0\nContrast in chestnut: exclusive leather and open-pored walnut\n\u00a0\nThe seats, fittings and door panels are partially lined in nappa and nubuk leather, the predominant colour tone being \"chestnut brown\". Echoing the exterior highlights, there are orange trim strips and seams in just a few places. The centre sections of the front seats have two parallel rows of perforations in their woven nubuk leather covers, revealing the orange-coloured fabric sub-layer. These extend from the front edge of the seat cushion to the upper edge of the integrated head restraint.\n\u00a0\nThe wood trim elements on the dashboard and centre console are of open-pored walnut. The walnut panels have a chiselled honeycomb pattern that fades out towards the edges. The pedals in the footwell feature decorative inserts in the same material within a high-gloss metal surround, with an identical honeycomb pattern.\n\u00a0\nDashboard: MBUX and off-road elements\n\u00a0\nThe basic architecture of the dashboard corresponds to that of the B-Class, with a widescreen cockpit facing the driver and the functions and displays controlled via the Mercedes-Benz User Experience - MBUX. New features are the off-road-type tubular elements in milled aluminium which round off the dashboard at the lower end. These give the dashboard support an impression of robustness, power and a certain fun factor. Below the three round centre nozzles is the air conditioning control panel with an intentionally analogue look, whose buttons create the impression that they have been milled from a solid aluminium cylinder.\n\u00a0\nThe robust character of the interior continues in the centre console. Aluminium tubular elements with a brushed structure in a grab-handle look lend solidity to the design of the components and controls. Along the doors, the SUV character is underlined by the horizontal grab handle that forms a robust part of the door panel structure as a machined aluminium tube.\n\u00a0\nPowertrain: Four-cylinder turbo with 165 kW/224 hp\n\u00a0\nThe Concept GLB is powered by the M 260 four-cylinder petrol engine combined with an 8G-DCT dual clutch transmission, with a maximum output of 165 kW/224 hp and peak torque of 350 Nm. The engine block of diecast aluminium with cast iron cylinder liners has CONICSHAPE\u00ae technology, which is also known in-house as \"trumpet-honing\". To further minimise piston friction and lower fuel consumption, the cylinder bore is widened at the lower end of the cylinder liners. The resulting, conical shape resembles the mouth of a trumpet.\n\u00a0\nAn innovative low-friction oil and optimised piston rings also reduce friction losses. To take account of the higher specific output, the pistons themselves feature cooling ducts. This also ensures more efficient combustion. The balance shafts for smooth engine-running are located in the lower section of the crankcase. To enhance comfort even further, there is a centrifugal pendulum damper in the powertrain.\n\u00a0\nAlso in the aluminium four-valve cylinder head is CAMTRONIC, a variable valve timing system that allows two-stage adjustment of the valve lift on the intake side of the valve assembly. In the partial-load range, this variable valve lift adjustment allows less air to be fed to the combustion chamber with a smaller valve lift, which leads to lower gas cycle losses. In higher load ranges the system switches to the higher valve lift to achieve the engine's full power delivery.\n\u00a0\nAll-wheel drive as a matter of course: 4MATIC with three selectable characteristics maps\n\u00a0\nThe Concept GLB is equipped with the permanent all-wheel system 4MATIC, with fully-variable torque distribution. This sporty all-wheel drive configuration allows the driver to use the DYNAMIC SELECT switch to influence the characteristics of 4MATIC. Three characteristic maps are available to control the all-wheel drive clutch, though the system responds flexibly to the current driving situation in any mode. In regular driving operation, the drive programme \"Eco/Comfort\" is based on an 80:20 distribution (front axle:rear axle), while in \"Sport\" it is 70:30. In off-road mode the all-wheel drive clutch acts as an inter-axle differential lock, with the basic distribution a balanced 50:50.\n\u00a0\n4MATIC components include the power take-off to the rear axle, which is integrated into the automated dual clutch transmission, and the rear axle differential with an integrated multiplate clutch. This is electro-mechanically operated. Via a crown wheel and a ball ramp, an electric motor exerts an axial force on the clutch pack to open or close the plates. The rear axle differential compensates the different paths/rotational speeds of the rear wheels. The advantages of this control system are above all non-rpm-dependent operation across the entire actuation range, pilot control of the clutch while still stationary and higher efficiency thanks to the ball ramp concept.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

It wants to look more \"boxy\" and \"rugged\"\u00a0 compared to GLA/GLC but yet falls short... So now it looks like a morph that is arrested halfway.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHere's how the standard version look like, as well as details of the latest SUV from Mercedes-Benz.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nPowerful proportions with short overhangs and off-road-oriented design as well as optional 4MATIC all-wheel drive and a special off-road light which helps detect obstacles immediately in front of the vehicle at low speeds - the new Mercedes-Benz GLB is a versatile SUV. And a spacious family car: on request it is the first Mercedes-Benz in this segment available as a seven-seater. The two seats in row three can be used by people up to 1.68 metres in height. With powerful and efficient four-cylinder engines, current driving assistance systems with cooperative support for the driver, the intuitively operable infotainment system MBUX plus the comprehensive convenience control ENERGIZING Comfort, the new family member (length/width/height: 4634/1834/1658 millimetres) has all the strengths of the current compact-class generation from Mercedes-Benz.\n\u00a0\nAt 2829 millimetres the GLB has ten centimetres more wheelbase than, for example, the new B-Class. Together with the function-oriented greenhouse this is decisive when it comes to the generous amount of space. The headroom in the first seat row is 1035 millimetres - a best in this segment. At 967 millimetres the effective legroom in the rear of the five-seater is at an especially comfortable level.\n\u00a0\nThe load compartment capacity of 560 to 1755 litres (figures for the five-seater) boasts the qualities of an estate. On request the second seat row can be longitudinally adjusted and as standard the inclination of the backrests is adjustable in several stages. This enables the load compartment to be enlarged by up to 179 litres and put to versatile use.\n\u00a0\n\nSuccess story: the eighth model in the compact car family\n\u00a0\nThe new GLB is manufactured at the Aguascalientes (Mexico) plant and, for the Chinese market, in Beijing. The GLB will be coming to the German sales partners at the end of this year.\n\u00a0\nOne in three Mercedes-Benz cars is now an SUV, and one in four a compact model. A compact SUV like the GLB therefore combines all the success factors of the company's highest-volume segments.\n\u00a0\nWith the new GLB the compact car family from Mercedes-Benz now consists of eight models: the A-Class, A-Class Saloon and long-wheelbase A-Class Saloon, B-Class, CLA Coup\u00e9, CLA Shooting Brake and the GLA are already on the market. In 2018 over 609,000 customers all over the world were able to take delivery of a compact model. Since the A-Class was launched in 1997, over 6.5 million vehicles from this segment have been sold worldwide by Mercedes-Benz.\n\u00a0\nReady for boarding: up to seven seats\n\u00a0\nThe GLB is the first compact vehicle from Mercedes-Benz to offer a third seat row on request with two additional individual seats. The seats offer people up to a height of 1.68 metres a comfortable amount of space. The extensive safety equipment includes retractable head restraints, seat belts with belt tensioners, a side window airbag which also protects the passengers in the third seat row plus ISOFIX and TOP-Tether anchorages for suitable child seats. These can be used to attach up to four child seats in the rear.\n\u00a0\nComfort details in the third row include two drinks holders between the seats as well as two stowage compartments with a rubberised insert on the left and right in the load compartment trim, each with a USB port. The seats can be lowered so that they are flush with the load compartment floor in order to extend the load compartment.\n\u00a0\nOff-road orientation: the exterior design\n\u00a0\nThe powerful proportions of the Mercedes-Benz GLB underscore the design with its off-road orientation: the surfaces of the forms are emphasised, and reduced lines and precise seams are major features. The upright front section with its striking headlamps is clear evidence of off-road genes, as are the short overhangs at the front and rear.\n\u00a0\nThe muscular and sensuously contoured vehicle shoulder dominates the side view at the height of the C-pillar, an effect reinforced by the rising waistline. The doors reach over the side bar, improving ease of access, and keep the door apertures free of soiling as well as increasing protection in a side impact. All-round protective claddings divide the overall proportions and emphasise the vehicle's off-road character, as does the simulated underride guard at the front and rear.\n\u00a0\n\"Its iconic design lends the Mercedes-Benz GLB an unmistakable SUV character\", says Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer at Daimler AG. \"The clear forms with reduced lines and powerful surfaces conveys our design philosophy of Sensual Purity.\"\n\u00a0\nWith aluminium details: the interior design\n\u00a0\nThe instrument panel consists of a single piece, which has optical cut-outs in the driver and front passenger area. The driver faces a widescreen cockpit, with control and display via MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience). A new feature is the characteristic off-road tubular element in an aluminium look which rounds off the lower section of the instrument panel and houses the three round centre air vents. These give the dashboard support an impression of robustness, power and a certain fun factor. Below the nozzles is the air conditioning control panel, whose buttons create the impression that they have been milled from a solid aluminium cylinder.\n\u00a0\nThe robust character of the interior continues in the centre console. Tubular elements in a machined look lend solidity to the design of the components and controls. Along the doors, the SUV character is underlined by the horizontal grab handle that, from the design and equipment line Progressive upwards, forms a robust part of the door panel structure and resembles a machined aluminium tube.\n\u00a0\nSpot on for hill and dale: the off-road light function\n\u00a0\nThe LED High Performance headlamps and MULTIBEAM LED headlamps are available for the Mercedes-Benz GLB on request. The latter allow extremely quick and precise, electronically controlled adjustment of the headlamps to suit the current traffic situation.\n\u00a0\nAs an option there are also front fog lamps with LED technology. They distribute the light more widely than the main headlamps and thus illuminate peripheral areas better. Their low position in the front bumper helps reduce the risk of dazzling.\n\u00a0\n4MATIC models include the Off-Road Engineering Package. In combination with MULTIBEAM LED headlamps these models offer a special off-road light function. This makes it easier to see obstacles in rough terrain in the dark. With the off-road light the cornering light on the MULTIBEAM LED headlamps is continuously switched on up to a speed of 50 km/h. This results in wide and bright light distribution immediately in front of the vehicle.\n\u00a0\nFrom A for Assistance to W for Wearable linking: the technical details\n\u00a0\nThe GLB benefits from the technical highlights of the current compact-class generation from Mercedes-Benz. These include in particular:\n\u00a0\n- The four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, which were completely updated to relaunch the compact model series: Compared to the previous generation, the excel with considerably increased specific outputs, improved efficiency and lower emissions.\n\u00a0\n- The driving assistance systems with cooperative support for the driver and functionality from the S-Class: thanks to improved camera and radar systems, the GLB can look up to 500 m ahead and can drive partially autonomously in certain situations, for example by conveniently adapting the speed before corners, crossroads or roundabouts using the Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC with recourse to maps and navigation data. As a new function of the Active Steering Assist, among other things, there is also the intuitive Active Lange Change Assist. If the Active Parking Assist with PARKTRONIC is additionally on board, the GLB also has the function extended automatic restart on motorways.\n\u00a0\n- The comfort suspension: at the front the GLB has McPherson suspension struts, at the rear an acoustically and vibrationally decoupled multi-link axle with compression springs. Adaptive adjustable damping is available on request. With this the driver can change between more comfort or particularly sporty tuning via the DYNAMIC SELECT switch.\n\u00a0\n- The intuitively operated infotainment system MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience): The powerful computer, brilliant screens and graphics, individualisable depiction, all-colour head-up display, navigation with augmented reality, learning-capable software and the voice control which can be activated with \"Hey Mercedes\" are the key advantages of the system.\n\u00a0\n- The ENERGIZING comfort control: it networks various comfort systems in the vehicle, and uses musical and lighting moods plus a number of massages for a wide range of feel-good programs. The ENERGIZING COACH recommends these programs according to the situation. If the Mercedes-Benz vivoactive\u00ae 3 smartwatch or another compatible Garmin\u00ae wearable is linked, personal values such as stress level or sleep quality improve the precision of the recommendation.\n\u00a0\nShould a tad more traction be called for: the 4MATIC all-wheel drive\n\u00a0\nOn request the Mercedes-Benz GLB is equipped with the permanent all-wheel system 4MATIC, with fully-variable torque distribution. This sporty all-wheel drive configuration allows the driver to use the DYNAMIC SELECT switch to influence the characteristics of 4MATIC. Three characteristic maps are available to control the all-wheel drive clutch, though the system responds flexibly to the current driving situation in any mode. In regular driving operation, the drive program \"Eco/Comfort\" is based on an 80:20 distribution (front axle:rear axle), while in \"Sport\" it is 70:30. In off-road mode the all-wheel drive clutch acts as an inter-axle differential lock, with the basic distribution a balanced 50:50.\n\u00a0\n4MATIC components include the power take-off to the rear axle, which is integrated into the automated dual clutch transmission, and the rear axle differential with an integrated multiplate clutch. This is electro-mechanically operated. Via a crown wheel and a ball ramp, an electric motor exerts an axial force on the clutch pack to open or close the plates. The rear axle differential compensates the different paths/rotational speeds of the rear wheels. The advantages of this control system are above all non-rpm-dependent operation across the entire actuation range, pilot control of the clutch while still stationary and higher efficiency thanks to the ball ramp concept.\n\u00a0\nUseful in easy off-road terrain: the Off-Road Engineering Package\n\u00a0\nIn addition to off-road light, the Offroad Engineering package has an additional driving mode. It adapts the engine's power delivery and the ABS control to easy off-road terrain away from tarmac roads. It can be activated via the DYNAMIC SELECT switch.\n\u00a0\nOther elements of the Off-Road Engineering Package:\n\u00a0\n- An animation of the driving situation can be called up in the media display. The realistic presentation of gradient, inclination angle and technical settings helps the driver to judge manoeuvres correctly.\n\u00a0\n- The hill-start assistance system Downhill Speed Regulation (DSR) automatically adheres to a preselected, slow speed between approx. 2 and 18 km/h, it can be read out in the instrument cluster and in the optional head-up display. With targeted brake applications the assistant helps retain control during steep downhill driving.\n\u00a0\nPowerful and efficient: the engines\n\u00a0\nThe new Mercedes-Benz GLB places its trust in the four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines which were completely updated to relaunch the compact model series. In comparison to the previous generation, they are characterised by significantly increased power, improved efficiency and emissions.\n\u00a0\nThe gateway to the petrol-model range is the M 282 with a displacement of 1.33 litres in the GLB 200. This engine has cylinder shutoff for efficient operation in the partial-load range.\n\u00a0\nThe two-litre M 260 engine in the GLB 250 4MATIC has cast-iron cylinder liners in its engine block of diecast aluminium, widening at the lower end as per the CONICSHAPE\u00ae principle. In-house the cylinder bore process is descriptively known as \"trumpet-honing\". This minimises piston friction and cuts consumption. In the aluminium four-valve cylinder head, the CAMTRONIC variable valve timing system allows two-stage adjustment of the valve lift on the intake side.\n\u00a0\nThanks to further extended exhaust gas aftertreatment the two-litre diesel (OM 654q) in the GLB 200 d/GLB 220 d with the 8G-DCT dual-clutch transmission already meets the RDE (Real Driving Emissions) level 2 not obligatory until 2020 and is certified in accordance with Euro 6d.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Coming from a subaru 2.5 4 pot turbo previously.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nGLB is using a newer version of the M270 (transverse) / M274 (longitude), code name M260 (transverse).\n\u00a0\nThe two-litre M 260 engine in the GLB 250 4MATIC (combined fuel consumption 7.4-7.2 l/100 km, combined CO2 emissions 169-165 g/km)1 has cast-iron cylinder liners in its engine block of diecast aluminium, widening at the lower end as per the CONICSHAPE\u00ae principle. In-house the cylinder bore process is descriptively known as \"trumpet-honing\". This minimises piston friction and cuts consumption. In the aluminium four-valve cylinder head, the CAMTRONIC variable valve timing system allows two-stage adjustment of the valve lift on the intake side.\n\u00a0\nTo further minimise piston friction and lower fuel consumption, the cylinder bore is widened at the lower end of the cylinder liners. The resulting, conical shape resembles the mouth of a trumpet. An innovative low-friction oil and optimised piston rings also reduce friction losses. To take account of the higher specific output, the pistons themselves feature cooling ducts. This also ensures more efficient combustion. The balance shafts for smooth engine-running are located in the lower section of the crankcase.\n\u00a0\nAlso new in the aluminium four-valve cylinder head of the two-litre engine is CAMTRONIC, a variable valve timing system that allows two-stage adjustment of the valve lift on the intake side of the valve assembly. In the partial-load range, this variable valve lift adjustment allows less air to be fed to the combustion chamber with a smaller valve lift, which leads to lower gas cycle losses. In higher load ranges the system switches to the higher valve lift to achieve the engine's full power delivery.\n\u00a0\nMultiple fuel injection ensures optimum combustion despite the smaller valve lift. This compensates the reduced turbulence of the fuel/air mixture in the combustion chamber in the area of the spark plug. The four-cylinder has direct injection with latest-generation piezo injection valves. The position of the injectors has been optimised to achieve low cylinder wall coverage and therefore lower untreated emissions, especially particulate emissions. A particulate filter is included as standard. Thanks to optimised injection with partial valve lift, the engine runs even more quietly in wide operating ranges. A low level of exhaust emissions has been achieved by further development of the well-proven BlueDIRECT combustion system in conjunction with the standard petrol particulate filter.\n\u00a0\nThe single-pipe turbocharger features an electronically controlled wastegate valve. The previously vacuum-operated actuator has been replaced by a precision electrical actuator, which reports its position and has a higher actuating speed, so that charge pressure control and diagnosis are significantly improved. This allows charging to be more precisely controlled.\n\u00a0\nThe oil circuit is supplied with engine oil on a demand basis. Sensors monitor the oil pressure so that the supply volume can be adjusted. The cooling circuit has an electronically controlled thermostat which allows the engine temperature to be optimally set to suit needs.\n\u00a0\nTo make engine operation more comfortable, a new centrifugal damper has been introduced into the powertrain as an addition to the balance shafts. This improves the engines NVH characteristics and allows comfortable driving possible at lower rpm. The exhaust system with flap control has the same purpose.\n\u00a0\nThe engine is configured for front-wheel drive and 4MATIC all-wheel drive, and combined with the 8G-DCT dual clutch transmission. The M 260 engine is produced by the K\u00f6lleda plant.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nAre all GLB will be manufacture in Mexico ?\n\u00a0\nFrom the official press release, yes.\n\u00a0\nThe new GLB is manufactured at the Aguascalientes (Mexico) plant and, for the Chinese market, in Beijing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMercedes-AMG GLB 35 Spied Hiding The Obvious\n\u00a0\n* For those interested, GLB 35 will be using the M 260 engine (same as GLB250, but tuned up to deliver 306 horsepower), while GLB 45 (and GLB 45S) will be using the newly developed M 139 engine, which is good for up to 416 horsepower.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe AMG lite version of the new GLB compact crossover will probably debut in the months to come.\n\u00a0\nThe first one to come will be the GLB 35 caught on camera again while undergoing testing ahead of a world reveal likely to take place before the end of the year. Having seen the standard GLB and knowing how AMG upgrades the cars for the \u201c35\u201d spec, it\u2019s easy to imagine what is hiding underneath the heavy camouflage. The big air intakes up front are already peeking through the camo, while the dual exhausts at the back further reveal it\u2019s not a regular GLB.\n\u00a0\nStretching out at the Green Hell, the compact crossover tuned in Affalterbach was riding low thanks to a stiffer suspension setup and also appeared to have bigger brakes to complement the upgraded engine. Speaking of which, a 2.0-liter four-cylinder will deliver 302 horsepower and 295 pound-feet (400 Newton-meters) to both axles with help from a dual-clutch, seven-speed automatic transmission.\n\u00a0\nAs far as performance is concerned, we are estimating the 0-62 mph (0-100k kph) task will take roughly five seconds to complete and top speed is likely to be electronically governed at 155 mph (250 kph). For an even faster version, the already spotted GLB 45 likely due in 2020 will up the power ante to as much as 416 hp and 369 lb-ft (500 Nm) in the flagship GLB 45 S. These \"45 S\" models from Mercedes' compact car lineup will feature the world's most powerful four-cylinder ever installed in a regular production vehicle.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

However, with the GLB\u2019s squarish shape officially revealed to the world, camouflage is falling from AMG GLB 45. This prototype was caught up close near the N\u00fcrburgring during a fuel stop, and our spy team wasn\u2019t shy about getting a close look.\n\u00a0\nTechnically speaking, we can\u2019t say for certain whether this is the GLB 45 or the lesser-powered GLB 35. Ordinarily, we\u2019d be able to tell the difference with a quick look at the rear, where a set of quad exhaust tips would reveal this as the 45. There are only two exhaust outlets on this SUV, though they obviously aren\u2019t standard-issue GLB 35 tips. The wheels don\u2019t help either, as we\u2019ve seen the GLB 35 riding on spokes like these, and on black five-star wheels captured on camera with a GLB 45 prototype.\n\u00a0\nUltimately, both muscle SUVs will have a similar appearance on the outside with tweaks to the front and rear fascias, and of course the trademark grille. Upgraded brakes and suspension will also be part of the AMG makeover, but the real difference comes under the hood. The GLB 35 should get the same 2.0-liter turbocharged four-pot that powers the AMG A35, generating 302 horsepower (225 kilowatts), and actually, the GLB 45 will probably have the 2.0-liter as well. It will be tuned considerably higher though, possibly up to 416 hp (310 kW) as found in the A45 S. At the very least, it should offer 383 hp (286 kW), which would still be enough to give this compact seven-seater plenty of thrust.\n\u00a0\nWe\u2019ve heard nothing official from Mercedes on when the AMG-tuned GLB models will debut. With the base model out and about right now, logic says the GLB 35 should arrive sometime later this year, possibly in September or even sooner. The GLB 45 should land either very late this year, or more likely, early in 2020.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

In America, the respective starting MSRPs for the two models are $33,950 for the GLA and $40,700 for the GLC.\n\u00a0\nBuilt on the same basic underpinnings as the new A-Class, albeit bigger to offer more passenger room and the option of a third row of seats, suitable for occupants up to 1.68 meters (about 5.6ft) in height, the boxy GLB technically rivals the Audi Q3 and BMW X1. However, the base X1 is available from \u20ac32,700 ($36,639), whereas the 2020 Q3 starts at \u20ac38,600 ($43,249).\n\u00a0\nThe only petrol engines available are the 163 PS (161 hp / 120 kW), 1.3-liter in the GLB 200 and 224 PS (221 hp / 165 kW), 2.0-liter in the GLB 250 4Matic.\n\u00a0\n\nThe diesel lineup is more generous, being offered in GLB 180d, GLB 200d, GLB 200d 4Matic and GLB 220d 4Matic guises. Pricing ranges between \u20ac37,770.60 ($42,320) and \u20ac44,601.20 ($49,973). These models share the same 2.0-liter power unit between them, which churns out 116 PS (114 hp / 85 kW) and 280 Nm (207 lb-ft) of torque in the most affordable variant, and 150 PS (148 hp / 110 kW) and 320 Nm (236 lb-ft) in the mid-range grades. The 220d 4Matic has 190 PS (187 hp / 140 kW) and 400 Nm (295 lb-ft).\n\u00a0\nModels packing the 4Matic all-wheel drive system have the standard Offroad Engineering Package, with Downhill Speed Regulation, an extra driving mode and additional off-road light. Elsewhere, you can spec your GLB with a wide range of options, including LED headlights and fog lamps, 360-degree camera system, head-up display, Burmester premium audio, heated steering wheel. Several packages, like the Business, Driving Assistance, Night and Start, with the latter being offered until the end of the year, are also on the list.\n\u00a0\nAdditionally, Mercedes-Benz is offering the GLB Edition 1 for a \u20ac9.044 ($10,133) premium, with 20-inch alloy wheels with opal orange rim flanges, bahia brown interior with coral red topstitching and walnut wood with coral red pattern.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Even my fren taking a lift from my car ask me to stop torturing the 14s car. Car engine roar very loud but speed is not there.\n\u00a0\n0-100 timing roughly lets you gauge how fast you can merge with expressway traffic, make a successful quick right turn, zoom out from slip road while traffic lights for oncoming traffic turns green or simply overtaking or undertaking.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\n\n\tMercedes-Benz GLB35 AMG 4Matic\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\tWith its passionate, striking design, great practicality and dynamics and space for up to seven occupants, the new Mercedes-AMG GLB35 4MATIC is an unrivalled alternative in the compact SUV segment. The turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine develops 225 kW (306 hp) and guarantees impressive driving enjoyment in combination with the AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G transmission and variable AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive (acceleration from 0-100 km/h in 5.2 seconds). Not to mention the advantages of an SUV: raised seating position, plenty of space for passengers and luggage, and well-balanced off-road performance.\n\n\n\n\t\"With the new GLB35 4MATIC we are extending our product portfolio by adding a highly attractive model for an active target group that attaches special importance to versatility. This also includes the optional seven-seater capability of our new compact SUV, though without having to sacrifice the genes typical of an AMG. Because in its segment, our GLB35 likewise fulfils our brand promise of Driving Performance,\" says Tobias Moers, CEO of Mercedes-AMG GmbH.\n\n\n\n\tResponsive and emotive: the AMG 2.0-litre 4-cylinder in-line turbocharged engine\n\n\n\n\tThanks to a twinscroll turbocharger, the 2.0-litre turbocharged engine rated at 225 kW (306 hp) impresses with great responsiveness to movements of the accelerator pedal, high torque (max. 400 Nm from 3000 rpm) and great liveliness. The crankcase made of high-strength, lightweight die-cast aluminium reduces the vehicle weight where it matters most for driving dynamics. The exhaust turbocharging combines optimum responsiveness at low engine speeds with a strong power increase at higher speeds.\n\n\n\n\tThe high technological level is also confirmed by CAMTRONIC variable valve control for low fuel consumption. Intelligent thermal management ensures a faster and more efficient warm-up of the engine and oil. And the compact piezo injectors deliver fuel extremely precisely for increased efficiency.\n\n\n\n\tFast and agile: AMG SPEEDSHIFT DCT 8G dual clutch transmission\n\n\n\n\tThe transmission masters fast gearshifts and a sporty driving style just as well as comfort-oriented gearshifts for relaxed long-distance journeys. During upshifts, partial ignition interruption produces an impressive sound experience, while the double-declutch function during downshifts benefits gearshifting comfort. The function synchronises the engine and transmission speeds, minimises unwanted gas cycle responses and stabilises the vehicle, for example when braking ahead of bends. This also supports a particularly dynamic driving style.\n\n\n\n\tThe new Mercedes-AMG GLB35 4MATIC displays its full sprint potential with the RACE START function included as standard. Higher engine rpm when starting off, in combination with optimised shift points, produces the best possible traction and maximum acceleration. RACE START remains active while the accelerator is kept fully depressed.\n\n\n\n\tDriving pleasure to the power of five: AMG DYNAMIC SELECT and AMG DYNAMICS\n\n\n\n\tThe five AMG DYNAMIC SELECT drive programs - Slippery, Comfort, Sport, Sport+ and Individual, make for a very variable driving experience with a wide range from serene comfort to agile and sporty. The programs modify key parameters, such as the response of the engine, transmission, suspension and steering.\n\n\n\n\t- The new \"Slippery\" drive program is optimised for low-grip road conditions, with reduced power and a flat torque curve. Smooth gear changes, earlier upshifts and the ECO start/stop system support the stability-focused driving impression.\n\n\n\n\t- The \"Comfort\" program stands for comfortable and fuel-efficient driving, for example thanks to very early upshifts. Suspension and steering are set up with an emphasis on comfort, the ECO start/stop system is active.\n\n\n\n\t- \"Sport\" and \"Sport+\" place the focus on agility and driving pleasure with sporty engine and transmission tuning. The ECO start/stop system is deactivated.\n\n\n\n\t- The \"Individual\" drive program enables the individual parameters to be selected and saved according to personal preferences. In addition, the gliding function is available in the \"Reduced\" and \"Moderate\" drive settings.\n\n\n\n\tThe driving modes are linked to the AMG DYNAMICS agility control, which means that the handling characteristics can be even more closely matched with different requirements and driving conditions.\n\n\n\n\tIn the GLB35 4MATIC, AMG DYNAMICS has the agility functions \"Basic\" and \"Advanced\", and their functionalities are automatically activated by the relevant drive program. Relevant parameters such as the torque distribution of the all-wheel drive system, the steering characteristics or the intervention thresholds of the completely newly developed ESP\u00ae (Electronic Stability Program) are intelligently adapted according to the drive program.\n\n\n\n\t- \"Basic\" is assigned to the \"Slippery\" and \"Comfort\" drive programs. In this case the GLB35 4MATIC has extremely stable handling with a high level of yaw damping.\n\n\n\n\t- \"Advanced\" is activated in the \"Sport\" program. The GLB35 4MATIC is then neutral and well-balanced. The lower level of yaw damping, reduced steering angles and increased agility support a dynamic driving style - for example on winding country roads.\n\n\n\n\tOptimum traction: variable AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drive\n\n\n\n\tThe performance-oriented all-wheel drive system continuously ensures the best possible ratio of dynamism, traction and efficiency. A multi-disc clutch with AMG-specific electromechanical control allows a variable torque split which can be instantly changed according to the driving situation. This ranges from purely front-wheel drive to a 50:50 percent distribution to the front and rear axle, for example during dynamic driving manoeuvres or on snow or ice. The influencing factors for torque distribution are not only the driving speed, the lateral and longitudinal acceleration and the steering angle, but also the difference in rotational speed between the individual wheels and the gear selected.\n\n\n\n\tThe all-wheel drive is regulated depending on the selected stage of the 3-stage Electronic Stability Program ESP\u00ae - from safety-oriented yet sporty to highly dynamic. The 4ETS dynamic handling control system further enhances handling safety and agility, in particular on slippery surfaces or on surfaces with different friction coefficients. It uses brake interventions to keep individual driven wheels from spinning when starting off or accelerating. At the same time the differential locking effect enables the drive torque to be shifted to the wheels that are not spinning.\n\n\n\n\tFor high lateral dynamics and long-distance comfort: the suspension\n\n\n\n\tThe AMG suspension is tuned for high cornering speeds with a low tendency to roll. This allows the dynamic potential of the GLB35 4MATIC to be fully realised. The high reserves at the critical limits guarantee sheer driving pleasure - while the vehicle remains safe and predictable at all times. The complete redesign of all wheel-guiding components such as the steering knuckles and transverse control arms at the front axle, as well as the model-specific subframe and the wheel carriers at the rear axle, assist even more direct steering and increase the lateral dynamics. At the same time the suspension developers at Mercedes-AMG took care to maintain a balanced level of long-distance comfort.\n\n\n\n\tFull control: speed-sensitive power steering and a high-performance brake system\n\n\n\n\tThe electromechanical, speed-sensitive power steering has a variable ratio and impresses with its precise and authentic feedback. The steering servo assistance is reduced at high speeds, and continuously increases at lower speeds. This means that comparatively little steering force is required at low speeds, while the best possible control over the vehicle is maintained at high speeds. Depending on which drive program the driver has selected, it provides taut and sporty or more comfortable steering feedback.\n\n\n\n\tThe AMG high-performance brake system with silver brake callipers and black AMG lettering at the front is a worthy counterpart to the powerful drive system. Deceleration is finely controllable, with high fade-resistance even under heavy stress. This is ensured for example by the large brake discs, which are internally ventilated and perforated all-round. The front axle is fitted with 4-piston fixed callipers and cast iron brake discs in size 350 x 34 mm, while the rear axle has 1-piston floating callipers and cast iron brake discs in size 330 x 22 mm.\n\n\n\n\tDesign: hallmark AMG expressiveness with personalisation potential\n\n\n\n\tBased on the AMG Line, the new GLB35 4MATIC is distinguishable by further model-specific design features. The AMG-specific radiator grille is used for the first time in a 35-series model, and emphasises membership of the AMG family. The front splitter, the prominent rear apron with two round, single tailpipe trim elements and the AMG roof spoiler in the vehicle colour also guarantee a high recognition factor.\n\n\n\n\tThe 19-inch AMG 5-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels painted in tantalum grey with a high-sheen finish and the AMG high-performance brake system with silver brake callipers and black AMG lettering at the front provide further visual highlights. Three further wheel variants from 19 to 21 inches are available on request, each in two colours.\n\n\n\n\tThe optional AMG Night package with design features such as the front splitter and rear apron trim in high-gloss black, plus black chrome-plated exhaust tailpipe trim elements, provides eye-catching highlights. Because depending on the chosen paint finish, the result is strong contrasts or flowing transitions.\n\n\n\n\tSporty and highly individualisable interior\n\n\n\n\tMembership of the AMG family is visually underlined by the sport seats upholstered in black ARTICO man-made leather/DINAMICA microfibre with red double topstitching and red seat belts. Two optional Leather packages with a choice of two-tone upholstery, for example in classic red/black, and topstitching on the beltline and dashboard, enhance the interior even further.\n\n\n\n\tWith AMG-specific displays: the MBUX infotainment system\n\n\n\n\tThe innovative control and display concept MBUX creates an even closer bond between the vehicle, driver and passengers. At the same time the latest version of the infotainment system contributes to the great day-to-day suitability of the new GLB35 4MATIC. Emotive displays such as the particularly striking Supersport mode with a central, round rev counter and bargraph-style driver information underline the exclusivity.\n\n\n\n\tWhether it's operated with the touchpad, Touch Control buttons on the steering wheel, by voice control or gesture control: the control concept is both versatile and flexible. Thanks to the innovative voice control - activated with the keyword \"Hey Mercedes\" - the AI software recognises and understands practically all commands common in infotainment and vehicle control - even when spoken indirectly.\n\n\n\n\tWith the three AMG-specific display styles \"Classic\", \"Sporty\" or \"Supersport\", the vehicle functions are directly visualised on the left side of the instrument cluster and in the touchscreen display on the right. Visually, the two displays under one shared glass cover blend into a Widescreen Cockpit and as a central element consequently emphasise the horizontal orientation of the interior design.\n\n\n\n\tObey any command: multifunction sports steering wheel\n\n\n\n\tThe multifunction sports steering wheel in nappa leather ensures first-class ergonomics and intuitive operation. The steering wheel rim with a flattened bottom section, perforated leather in the grip area and red contrasting topstitching is both attractive and pleasant to the touch. The galvanised steering wheel gearshift paddles allow an even sportier driving style with manual gear shifting.\n\n\n\n\tThe optional AMG Performance steering wheel and accompanying AMG steering wheel buttons are visibly and tangibly configured for performance. This allows fast and confident operation of specific dynamic functions - for a focussed, concentrated and performance-oriented driving style.\n\n\n\n\tTwo more passengers with the optional third seat row\n\n\n\n\tThe new GLB35 4MATIC is the first compact car by Mercedes-AMG to be optionally available with a third seat row consisting of two additional individual seats, plus fore-and-aft adjustment of the second seat row and the EASY-ENTRY feature. The second seat row has a 40:60 split. The seats in the third row accommodate passengers up to a height of 1.68 metres in comfort. The seats can be lowered so that they are flush with the load compartment floor in order to extend the load compartment.\n\n\n\n\tConvenience features in the third row include two drink holders between the seats and two stowage compartments with rubber-lined inserts on the left and right in the load compartment panelling. Each of these is fitted with a USB charging socket. The extensive safety equipment underlines the high day-to-day suitability. It consists of extendable head restraints, seat belts with belt tensioners and belt force limiters, a window airbag that also protects the passengers in the third seat row, and i-Size/ISOFIX and Top-Tether anchorages for suitable child seats.\n\n\n\n\tEven more dynamism: the AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension\n\n\n\n\tThe optionally available AMG RIDE CONTROL suspension guarantees superior performance. The adaptive, electronically controlled damping provides a wide range of setups from comfortable to very sporty. The damping is adjusted individually for each wheel, and depends on the driving style, the road surface and the selected suspension setting.\n\n\n\n\tThe best possible operating point is always selected on the basis of numerous data such as acceleration or vehicle speed. The suspension characteristics are modified by simply selecting one of the drive programs Comfort, Sport or Sport+.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
