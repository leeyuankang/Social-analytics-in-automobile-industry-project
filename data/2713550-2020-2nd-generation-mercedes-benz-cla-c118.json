MERCEDES-BENZ CLA SHEDS SOME CAMOhttps://www.motortrend.com/news/spied-mercedes-benz-cla-sheds-some-camo/\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nJust a few months ago, our spy photographers\u00a0caught a next-generation CLA prototype\u00a0out testing, possibly in AMG form. Now, the CLA has returned wearing a different grille and less camouflage.\nThough that earlier prototype appeared to wear\u00a0Mercedes-AMG's Panamericana grille, this CLA sports a front end inspired by the\u00a0CLS-Class. The camouflage obscures the shape of the headlights, but the LED accents look similar to those of its swoopy big brother. It's also safe to say the taillights have changed. Unless the camo is fooling us, the rear end looks more upright than before. Overall, the new model looks longer than its predecessor.\nA few interior shots reveal a more streamlined cabin. This prototype features one large screen that runs across the dashboard, replacing the two separate screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system. The circular vents take on a different look, and there is now a simpler array of buttons just below. Red contrast stitching and a flat-bottom steering wheel hint at AMG roots, but this car doesn't look like an AMG from the exterior. It's possible Mercedes will offer some sort of AMG interior package, or that this prototype is just a mixed bag of parts.\nAccording to\u00a0Autocar, Mercedes has confirmed it will launch the CLA and CLA Shooting Brake next year. We don't know Mercedes' exact plans for the U.S. market, but the model will likely slot above the new\u00a0A-Class\u00a0with a sleeker coupe-like profile. The interiors of the A-Class and CLA should be very similar.\nThe CLA could share engines and gearboxes with the A-Class. Our A-Class comes with a 2.0-liter turbo-four making 188 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. An\u00a0AMG version of the A-Class\u00a0is also very likely coming to the U.S., although it's unclear how much power it will make.\nPhoto source: CarPix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Admittedly when it first came out, local AD didn\u2019t install driver memory seats which was disappointing to say the least but it has since been rectified n so now it has this feature. \u00a0\nBack to CLA n like what bro Fuelsaver mentioned, the sloping roofline makes for a tight headroom but then again it\u2019s a coupe afterall so u can\u2019t have it both ways.

There are also ingenious details when it comes to the aerodynamics and new functions for the Intelligent Drive driving assistance package. The design underlines the coup\u00e9 character with its stretched form and design elements such as the bonnet with powerdomes or the rear licence plate which has been moved down. As such it does justice to its predecessor\u2019s status as a design icon.\n\u00a0\nWith MBUX, Mercedes-Benz has been revolutionising how to operate a car and communicate with it since the launch of the\u00a0A-Class. \u201cNow we go to the next level with an intelligent interior assistance system for the compact class. By recognising gestures it facilitates natural operation,\u201d says Ola K\u00e4llenius, Member of the Board of Management of Daimler\u00a0AG, responsible for Group Research and Mercedes-Benz Cars Development. \u201cThis is not the only new feature by which the CLA offers a great deal of automotive intelligence.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWith the first CLA we celebrated a huge success by selling some 750,000 vehicles and created a totally new segment with a four-door coup\u00e9,\u201d adds Britta Seeger, Member of the Board of Management of\u00a0Daimler\u00a0AG, responsible for Mercedes-Benz Cars Marketing & Sales. \u201cThe new edition of the CLA has been developed further in an intelligent way and is even more emotional and sportier than its predecessor. Coupled with new operating systems, it sets new benchmarks for the entire class.\u201d\nThe new generation of compacts has made a key contribution to the rejuvenation and image change of the Mercedes-Benz brand. The CLA is important for winning and retaining new customers in particular. The CLA Coup\u00e9 was launched in the USA in 2013, making it the first compact MercedesBenz on the American market. At peak times, more than two thirds of CLA buyers in the USA came from competitors. On average, CLA customers in the USA are around ten years younger than the typical MercedesBenz customer. In Europe, too, CLA customers are among the youngest in the Mercedes portfolio. In 2017, one in two customers in Europe previously drove a competitor's vehicle. Over 75 percent of European customers who previously drove a CLA as a coup\u00e9 or Shooting Brake chose a MercedesBenz again for their next vehicle. In total, some 750,000 units of the first-generation CLA Coup\u00e9 and CLA Shooting Brake contributed considerably to the compact car's success.\n\u00a0\nIn its first year, the new CLA will also be available as an Edition 1. In terms of both the exterior and the interior, this limited edition special model has numerous visual accents which underline its exclusivity. The new CLA will be manufactured at the Kecskem\u00e9t plant (Hungary) and comes onto the market in May 2019.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs a four-door coup\u00e9, the new CLA intrigues with its puristic, seductive design and sets new standards in the design DNA of \u2018sensual purity\u2019. It impresses with its perfect proportions reflecting the first design sketch: a long, stretched bonnet, a compact greenhouse, a wide track with exposed wheel arches and our typical GT rear end with a strong distinctive \u2018Coke-bottle shoulder\u2019,\u201d says Gorden Wagener, Chief Design Officer of Daimler AG. \u201cIn short - the CLA Coup\u00e9 has the potential to become a modern design icon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe combination of the long, stretched entry line above the windows and frameless doors give the CLA Coup\u00e9 its unmistakeable sporty and elegant character. Forming the front end is the striking front section which is raked forwards like a shark nose with a long, stretched bonnet featuring powerdomes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nOriginal article at\u00a0http://9tro.com/media/news/the-new-mercedes-benz-cla-coupe\nThe 2nd Generation CLA will be officially unveiled at the CES 2019 event at 3am 9th Jan (SG time).

MERCEDES-BENZ CLA SHEDS SOME CAMO\nhttps://www.motortrend.com/news/spied-mercedes-benz-cla-sheds-some-camo/\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\nJust a few months ago, our spy photographers\u00a0caught a next-generation CLA prototype\u00a0out testing, possibly in AMG form. Now, the CLA has returned wearing a different grille and less camouflage.\nThough that earlier prototype appeared to wear\u00a0Mercedes-AMG's Panamericana grille, this CLA sports a front end inspired by the\u00a0CLS-Class. The camouflage obscures the shape of the headlights, but the LED accents look similar to those of its swoopy big brother. It's also safe to say the taillights have changed. Unless the camo is fooling us, the rear end looks more upright than before. Overall, the new model looks longer than its predecessor.\nA few interior shots reveal a more streamlined cabin. This prototype features one large screen that runs across the dashboard, replacing the two separate screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system. The circular vents take on a different look, and there is now a simpler array of buttons just below. Red contrast stitching and a flat-bottom steering wheel hint at AMG roots, but this car doesn't look like an AMG from the exterior. It's possible Mercedes will offer some sort of AMG interior package, or that this prototype is just a mixed bag of parts.\nAccording to\u00a0Autocar, Mercedes has confirmed it will launch the CLA and CLA Shooting Brake next year. We don't know Mercedes' exact plans for the U.S. market, but the model will likely slot above the new\u00a0A-Class\u00a0with a sleeker coupe-like profile. The interiors of the A-Class and CLA should be very similar.\nThe CLA could share engines and gearboxes with the A-Class. Our A-Class comes with a 2.0-liter turbo-four making 188 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque, which is paired with a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. An\u00a0AMG version of the A-Class\u00a0is also very likely coming to the U.S., although it's unclear how much power it will make.\nPhoto source: CarPix\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nthat hidden red button in the centre console... i wonder if its to eject noisy passengers.\u00a0\nIf yes, James would love it.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
