And I've also test-driven a 2011 B200 (W246). So, here's my two cents:\n\u00a0\n\nTiguan\n\u00a0\n\nFor an SUV, the Tiguan handles very well. Performance from the 155kW engine that it shares with the Golf GTI is acceptable, enabling the relatively hefty vehicle to do the 0-100 sprint in 7.4 secs. Interior is spacious and very flexible, with a rear bench that slides fore and aft and backrests that have varying angles of incline. A base model Tiguan feels cheap, but an up-specced version feels like an entirely different car. Mine came with most of the options available for the Australian market (i.e. leather upholstery, heated seats, electric adjustment for driver's seat, rear picnic tables, panoramic sunroof, Park Assist 2.0, RNS510 sat nav with reversing camera, 18\" alloys, bi-xenons) but sans the ACC, which inflated the final driveaway price by quite a fair bit. To give you some peace of mind, Tiguans are built in Wolfsburg, Germany. And the DSG unit used is the 7-sp DQ500 that is more reliable than the DQ200 and DQ250 used in Polos and Golfs. The biggest criticism against the Tiguan is its smallish 395L boot, but if you have no issues with the A3's even smaller boot, than this shouldn't be a major concern for you.\n\u00a0\n\nB200 (W246)\n\u00a0\n\nCompared to the W245 B-Class, the W246 represents a step forward in interior quality (provided you spec up your car) and handling. But the use of a conventional monocoque chassis in place of the old sandwich platform meant the W246 has grown in its exterior dimensions whilst also sacrificing some boot space, from the massive 544L of the older model to a still-decent 486L in the new model. Placement of the screen is now more logical; i.e. on top of the dash so that you can keep your eyes on the road. The COMAND APS system can now receive traffic updates and spoken street names via its Linguatronic feature, whereas I had to spell out street names in the older B-Class. And best of all, the new B-Class actually costs less than the older version when compared spec for spec. To put things into perspective, my B200 Turbo matches my Tiguan in performance (142kW and 0-100 in 7.6 Secs) and specs (optioned with leather upholstery, heated seats, panoramic sunroof, active park assist, COMAND APS sat nav, 18\" AMG alloys, bi-xenons, Harman Kardon Logic 7 sound system), and both cost exactly the same price. So, a price reduction for the new model is good news indeed. My only gripe with the B200 is its relative lack of power compared to my B200 Turbo. If Mercedes Australia had announced the launch of the recently introduced B250 just a few months earlier, I would've bought it instead of my Tiguan, as the Merc is more fuel efficient, has a bigger boot and comes with 3 years of free servicing under the corporate program.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

You'll get good fuel economy and road tax savings too.\n\u00a0\n\nHowever, in Sydney where I live, steep hill climbs are pretty common. I've test-driven various cars that include 2.4L RAV4s and CR-Vs, and 3.0L X1s, and they need to be revved hard in order to keep up with traffic going up long slopes. My 2.0L turbos have enough torque not to feel overly strained. Most surprising experience was with a Merc C200 CDI courtesy car that outpaced even a 4.0L Falcon when climbing a 500m stretch. The torque from these diesel engines is simply amazing.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Can't really complain, as i am getting good mileage and reasonable acceleration.\nSteering is fine, as less feedback means you feel less stress with sensing the road.. I actually feel it is more comfortable this way.. Suspension comfort for family of 4 is just right. Surely, if you like taking corners at high speed, feedback is important, but do you really want to take a family car at such high speed into a corner?\n\u00a0\nThere is turbo lag, hence from 1000 rpm to 1500rpm, you will feel abit of reluctance to move forward.\nOnce you past this lag, the car performs very well.\nSpace is good for most people, but for taller folks, you may need to try a few times of getting in and out of car, to see if you are ok with it.\nWith our tax structure in Singapore, this low cc with turbo makes sense to me... Low rd tax, low consumption, but still enough power for some joy in driving... : )\nWatch your speed! It is too easy to go beyond the limit with it's 7 speed gearbox... Drive safe!\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Depends if you value the interior design or the drive.\nInterior aesthetics is subjective. The local carbuyer reviewer finds the 218i's interior more posh than the B180. Furthermore, I believe the B180 does not comes with keyless entry, electric tailgate and navigation. Adding all these options will most likely make the B180 costs even more than the 216d GT which has all these options plus 7 seat option. \u00a0\nThat said, to each its own. But I think generally Mercedes has a higher premium than BMW in Singapore and Taiwan and prob the rest of the world. Even their options are also more expensive, for example if u need sunroof, it will cost more to add for Merc than in BMW. Expensive or not, the buyer must feel justified. For some, Merc is def worth the premium and that's fine. There are ppl who swear by Toyota too. No disrespect to Toyota.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Saw other users mentioned that.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI am not sure about the jerkiness others are feeling, but being an auto-manual gear (DCT), when you down-shift if the car is running, you should feel the same engine brake effect as the same as manual cars when they down-shift. In fact I have tried just using down-shifting when making a turn without using brakes, which I feel is the fun factor of using DCT.\n\u00a0\n3, Is the absence of rear-aircon bothering you? (Anyway the car is short)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNope, B Class got 3 very powerful air vents in front. Aim one at passenger, one at driver and the last one aim straight behind, definitely enough to cool the passengers. Rear aircon vents not good if ladies sit in between leh. hee hee hee.\nOh for those very very hot day, I have placed a USB fan behind for my kids (power comes from the 12V point located behind), cooler than any aircon vents.\n\u00a0\nReliability wise, Mercedes has a rather high reliability factor, maybe only lose to Toyota and Honda. But the parts will be higher cost a bit.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited February 1, 2016 by Silverkris\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Anyone plan or have change the tires to normal with a standby tire kit.\n\u00a0\nThanks everyone for sharing.. Have a nice weekend.\nBTW, any chance for us to use Apple Carplay on our B180? Will be nice if can use google navigation directly.\nHi, here are some observations after driving for about 3 weeks.\n\u00a0\n1. The startup engine noise seems to be louder with a increase in \"tack ...tack....tack sound\" but diminish after warm up.\n2. HO film is all clear and seems to work well under the scorching sun when park outdoor for 8 hours.\n3. The Run Flat tires are also noisier but offer good grip.\n4.

However, they should only void warranty on areas related to the mod.

It's precisely due to the torque that the engine doesn't feel stressed.\n\u00a0\nBMW diesels don't require adblue. Citroen diesels require though so depends on car make.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAs for maintenance costs, PML claims not much difference between diesel and petrol maintenance but this 216d model is too new for owners to vouch if true or not.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Admittedly MFA cars have less complaints about their 7G-DCT failing than Volkswagen group models but car reviewers also say Mercedes ought to go to a class hosted by Audi on how to make the damn things.\n\u00a0\nJust follow the usual recommendations for handling a DCT. Avoid excessive crawling, allow wider distances so the computer doesnt have to half-clutch as often, for example.\nYou might need to replace transmission fluid, but I doubt the clutches will wear out substantially faster than a manual if you drive like a manual. Heck, it might last longer since there's two clutches.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Hard to explain which is better, it really depends on the engine that is paired with it too. Engine and gear boxes must match.\n\u00a0\nPut it this way then:\n\u00a0\n7G-Tronic - Old Technology but quite reliable. Last time only luxury cars can get up to 7 gears, Toyotas that time uses 4 gears and Honda mostly 5 gears. But now all cars seems to have this gearbox.\n\u00a0\n7G-DCT - New Technology, the double clutches enables minimum loss of transmission power from engine to wheels. eg, when 7G-Tronic gears disengages from gear 1 to gear 2, at that point of time, when you step on the gas, the engine cannot transmit the power to your wheels at least until the next gear is engaged. The DCT gearboxes do not have such problems. This new gearbox technology works wonderfully for the car but it is complicated (expensive to repair).\n\u00a0\n9G-Tronics - As the name suggests, it uses old technology but with 9 gears instead. More gears means the car has more ratios to choose from during the drive, and I think it should be very economical and efficient though I can't think of any situations that requires a 9th gear, most probably travelling at above 200km/hr?\n\u00a0\nSo far none of the car manufacturers can create a 9G-DCT that can combine the best of both worlds though Audi is launching (or if they still can) a 8G-DSG (equivalent to 8G-DCT) soon on their new models.\n\u00a0\nHope the above can answer your questions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nThe perception of poor 'smoothness' for DCT usually happens when the DCT is confused by or mispredicts driver action.\n\u00a0\nA DCT typically achieves a gear change within double digit milliseconds, resulting in a seemingly imperceptible shift with the lowest amounts of power loss due to disconnection of any transmission type yet by disengaging one clutch and engaging the other simultaneously.\n\u00a0\nBut due to their design, DCTs usually pre-select gears based on prediction, and their pre-selection process usually happens on the presently non-engaged gear-set. Typically a DCT preselects the next higher gear if it detects the driver as accelerating or preselects a lower gear if decceleration or braking is detected. The issue is that DCTs these days don't have discretion of a seasoned manual driver; the preselection takes place in a fashion similar to the older automated single clutch boxes; that is to say slowly and jerkily... like a newbie driver - rough engagement of the clutch.\n\u00a0\nSo if the gearbox mispredicts driver action, it has to make up for it by choosing the right gear, which takes much longer than the simple clutch switchover which would be what is happening with a correctly predicted and preselected gear, perhaps even longer than conventional torque convertor boxes do. Or worse, if it has to step down two gears, meaning it has to select another gear\u00a0on the currently engaged clutch, it typically executes the action even more uncomfortably.\n\u00a0\nIt also depends on your definition of \"smooth\". Smooth acceleration, without interruptions? DCT is best. Smooth and consistent gear changes? Conventional autos might be better.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Just be careful that you do not accidentally redline in this manner, but I expect the 7G-DCT to have programming that rejects overambitious downshifts.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The advices are basically correct as not to do \"half clutches\" often when inching forward, but this will also apply to the other gear boxes as well. Slowly inching forward will result wear-and-tear in all clutches, not only DCT/DSG. Remembering how we learn half clutch using manual gearboxes when we took our driving lessons?\n\u00a0\nAs to which gear box is the best out of manual / convention auto / CVT / DCT/DSG, it really depends on the engine and purpose of the car the manufacturer intends (fuel efficient? power efficiency? performance? driver engagement?).\n\u00a0\nIf you ask me, best gearbox should be those in the F1 cars (similar but not totally same as DCT, since the gear changes are still manual), where the gearbox is able to take on the power of the engine seamlessly.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Constantly updated for new roads + traffic conditions. This is important especially in Singapore which the roads are constantly changing now. I think the new B already comes with Apple Carplay? that will be good enough?\n\u00a0\nWarrnty only becomes void for battery if you installed your own camera. (I did to Iroad). Other than that, warranty will remains for others according to the purchase contract.\n\u00a0\nGo for taobao to do whatever you want to protect the car. Lots of choices.\n\u00a0\nAdditional: If you can squeeze in a leather wrapped steering wheel for the B class if you are going for style edition will be best. Still can't imagine a luxury car that doesn't come with a leather wrapped steering wheel.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The long wait was because they didn't have stock for the colour combination I wanted and it had to be ordered from the factory.\n\u00a0\nInterestingly, I have seen the display car in the showroom get sold twice. Once back in Dec they had a mountain grey piece, and more recently a white one. Seems some people don't mind taking the display car to avoid the 6-7 months waiting time.\n\u00a0\nThis year's B-Class MY17 model gets Apple CarPlay thrown in as standard, though it's a bit clunky as the floating iPad screen is not touchscreen. There is no option for Android Auto, which Android users may want to take note of.\n\u00a0\nI also notice that my rear bumper has a chrome lip, which many of the B-Classes on the road don't seem to have. Not sure if this was already there for earlier FL models.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I can only draw a conclusion that B owners are mostly family man and probably spent more time with kid than outing/excursion \n\u00a0\nAs I hardly login to check the messages even though there is a prompt from the forum if someone commented on the post, I think I will stick to the\u00a0simpler way, which is through whatapps.\n\u00a0\nI do not know how will the response be but let me take the lead in creating one. Anyone of you (B class owner) who are keen to join the B-class Whatapps Group, please PM me. Again, my apology and do expect some delay to my response due to travelling. Thank you very much!\n\n\u00a0\nhaha.... B class is most only family. Seldom ppl join the club. I only the ones B class in the club haha~\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Previously when looking to renew insurance for my old car I still took ntuc in the end as their orange riders really makes things convenient. But that was when my car was almost 7 years old and not serviced by AD. \u00a0\nIf I were you, I would probably still stick to AIG since they\u2019re the insurance covering C&C. And it helps that their price is the lower of the 2. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Volvo comes close, but the lower sitting position makes it a big minus for older folks like me\n- very easy and relative cheap to find spares\n- fantastic radio reception and decent sound from stock speakers and the Audio 20 system\n- Carplay in the 2017 models\n- dipstick present\n- OMV is about 2-3k less for the same model\n- CEVS is 5k instead of 10k so you get more money back at the end\n- nicer sounding engine and more responsive when you kickdown\n- slightly more spacious at the back with a bit more headroom\n- better suited to those who are tall and have long legs\n- 8\" high res screen\n- better collision warning and driver sleepy function\n- gear shift is where the right stick / turn indicator is in a Jap car - takes some getting used to, and of course some will worry about going in reverse, which you can't\n- you take delivery of your car in the same place as the other cars from C&C, albeit in a quiet separate room, whereas there's a nice area in the BMW showroom. Of course if you bought a higher BMW / Merc, they will bring you to an even better spot..\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBoth cars have some very odd cost cutting measures and you do know that they are both entry level cars in the premium marques:\n\u00a0\nVinyl instead of leather\nEach misses out on some features, eg no leather steering on the Merc, no cruise control on the BMW\nA few cheap bits of plastic are found in both cars, though the BMW has less of them. The 2011 designed Merc has more down below, although most of the plastics seem well put together. The straight lines of the Merc may not suit everyone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEach has it's virtues and in the new year, the 216d will be replaced by the 216i, which is slower but potentially smoother and quieter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYMMV on the looks and ergonomics so make sure you sit down and try it, and also drive them to see which one suits you.\u00a0\nBoth cars are stable at speed, offer good safety features and good space.\nPlus they give you a hint of the premium and luxury that you can get further up the food chain..\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited November 30, 2017 by therock\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Well it is likely that these buyers will gravitate towards the Toyotas and the more basic cars with manual this, and that..\nAlso, you have buyers who rather have leather, DRLs and skip on the airbags...\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe second group spend time upgrading their manual mirrors, add DRLs, want auto-brake, want more power etc etc...\u00a0\nBy the time you add in all the extra features, you will notice that the cost of the car actually approaches the next price level. But the OMV is much lower.\u00a0\nSo this car gives a balance - the OMV is about 26k, and you get a host of safety features, mod cons, and you have to decide if the menu of features suit you.\nEg the BMW 216, it's immediate rival, has rear seats which can move forward and also can recline. The tailgate is electric.\u00a0\nBut it lacks cruise control, and some auto-brake features. It's also a diesel. But it uses a very sweet Aisin Jap GB.\n\u00a0\nThe look is also a tad more dated in the B Class since it was first released in 2011, and updated end 2014.

You lose out in some premium feel, and the leather is synthetic, and you do see some cost cutting features here and there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut you will enjoy premium service, a very sweet radio, that has no distortion, and the sound from the speakers is quite decent too.

It can be jerky at low speeds. The car feels best at cruise on the expressway. The car has lots of electronics and can sometimes act up. The alarm will sometimes beep to warn me of slippery road when it is not, or thinks I am falling asleep when I am not. The proximity indicator will sometimes sound for nothing. Half of my ambient lighting failed for a few days then came back up. I like the thick metal/ heavy doors - makes me feel safe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnyway, I bought it not because it is a Merc. I bought it because it was value for money. At that time, it was cheaper than a Camry and same net price as the Hyundai i40 that I wanted to buy, and came with more features and space. It was also better built but of course not to C, E, or S class level.\n\u00a0\nI suppose some S class people will not be happy, and some Hyundai/ Toyota folks will not believe it, and keep calling us names.

Small issues that others have faced are the peeling of the leather on the steering, the area around the seat belt holder wearing off and some such wear and tear issues. The pre facelift version has no CPA + and no Comfort mode on the gearbox.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt's a good car, but you have to make sure you are not paying too much.

Borneo Motors took over the Toyota franchise in 1967.\nHis relatives owned the Green Bus Co, one of several private operators here before Singapore Bus Service was formed in 1973.\nMr Ong's taste in cars is largely pragmatic.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\"We were parts stockist for Ford, so I drove Ford cars,\" he says. \"When we had the Toyota business, I drove Toyota cars.\"\nBut in recent years, he added Mercedes-Benz to the mix. Currently, he drives a Mercedes B180, a mini multi-purpose vehicle which he says is \"very practical\".\nHis retiree wife - they have been married for 51 years - drives a Mercedes C180 sedan.\nThe couple have two grown-up sons - one works for semiconductor giant Intel and the other for Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.\nOn the B180, Mr Ong says: \"It is very spacious. Four big pieces of luggage can go in without folding any seat.\n\"Recently, we bought a 2.4m-tall Christmas tree and it fit. Of course, we had to fold down the seats.\"\nDespite its spaciousness, the car is compact, which is \"good for Singapore, especially when parking\".\nHe also likes its automatic parking function and says the car is fairly efficient, clocking seven to eight litres per 100km.\nHe bought the car new five years ago. Before that, he drove a Toyota Camry, which was preceded by a Mercedes-Benz 190E.\nThe energy industry veteran has a few tips to help motorists stretch their dollar.\n\"Maintain your car well and don't drive like a madman,\" he advises.\n\"And don't use 98-octane fuel. Most cars will run well on 95-or 92-octane,\" he adds. \"Not only that, 98 contains more benzene, which causes leukaemia.\"\nHe asserts that \"all petrols are the same\".\n\"When one company runs low on supply, it will get some from another company,\" he says. \"It's only the additives which are different. But even that, additives are mainly detergent.\"\nFor his next car, he is contemplating an electric model.\n\"But I'm worried about its resale value,\" he says. \"Will anyone buy a used electric car?\"\tWHAT'S IN THE BOOT?\u00a0\nST PHOTO: ALPHONSUS CHERN\u00a0\n\u2022 Company brochures and files\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInteresting that he uses Ron 95...\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Quite easy to install, just pull out the original covers and cover with the new ones. Very worth it at less than S$20. Took a risk as never include B class in the description but got it anyway. Turned out perfect.\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BMVPJK2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00__o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHope this help fellow owners to improve the car ownership experience. Cheers.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited February 9 by Heartlander\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Im surprise it doesnt come with full function of keyless go, its just keyless start. Kind of funny way to open door via remote but yet the car not required to plug the key.\n2. I really wish it does come with auto tailgate which will give so much convenient.\n\u00a0\nMay i check with u all if theres possible way to install this function but doesnt void the warranty?\n\u00a0\nThanks\n\n\u00a0\nWelcome bro,\n\u00a0\nThe electronic tailgate can be done by yourself, i found one seller for the spare part in taobao, it is about $600. i am also interested in the same, we can buy together and do it together if you like. PM me\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Or prestige?\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\u00a0\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tFor the money, there are quite a few 5 seat MPV choices on the market...\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tThe reason I asked is because if the costs are a big concern, even if you visit stockists, external workshops etc, there is still a cost and it will be more than servicing a Toyota / Honda for example.\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\tIf I am looking at something in a 5-seater \u201dmini-MPV\u201d, or rather, a 5-seater hatchback\u00a0with comparable cabin space to a B-Class, what are the options out there? Conti or otherwise?\u00a0Besides BMW 2-Series anyway.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
