And unlike the outgoing GLK, the new GLC will be made available to right-hand drive markets, including, of course, Britain. \n\u00a0\n\n\n\n \nLinked to Mercedes' C-Class series \u2013 hence the change in the name from GLK to GLC, the SUV rides on a longer wheelbase version of the sedan's Modular Rear Architecture and will be offered in Europe with a starting lineup of three engines. These include the diesel-powered GLC 220d 4Matic with 168hp (0-62mph or 100km/h in 8.3 sec and 56mpg UK), and GLC 250d 4Matic with 201hp (0-62mph or 100km/h in 7.6 sec and 56mpg UK), and the petrol GLC 250 4Matic with 208hp (0-62mph or 100km/h in 7.3 sec and 43mpg UK).In North America, the GLC will launch this fall as the rear-wheel drive GLC 300 and all-wheel drive GLC 300 4Matic, which should have the same 241hp 2.0-liter turbocharged four as the C300 sedan \u2013 we're still waiting for Mercedes' to release US specs. \n \n\n\n \nAdditional powertrains, including a plug-in hybrid variant and AMG models, will follow later on.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n \nSource: Carscoops\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited June 18, 2015 by missmarigold\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I did not do the TD so I have no idea how they drive. Which model and engine are you interested in?\n\u00a0\nIn my view, they are quite different cars to the F10.

Nobody needed the car, its a 4 seater, its impractical, and its ugly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen, LR followed suite with its Evoque. Now Merc go all in with not 1 but 2 SUV coupes. ... GLE coupe and GLC coupe .... and possibly a GLS coupe in the coming years.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo me, they all look the same. A coupe on stilt with large wheel arches and wide tyres.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe GLC (both coupe and SUV) interior is directly taken from W205 C class ... while it pleases the mainstream, i still dont like the steering mounted gear stalk and the gimmicky touch interface \"mouse\" on control knob. While the switch gears of the new Mercs of high perceived quality, its ergonomics is both well thought and has learning curve.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nX4 comparatively uses the older X3 interior instead of the F32/34 newer design. Probably their mistake, but its ergonomics is direct, no nonsense, and iDrive natural to use. Its doesnt look as sophisticated as the GLC, but functional nonetheless.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nExterior looks is highly subjective. Its like comparing Matt Damon to Will Smith. Neither look particularly handsome.... but attractive in their own way.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf i have to choose one, since neither appeals to me physically, its the chassis and drive train (the inner beauty) that matters. In this case, the bimmer drives like an ultimate driving machine, whereas the GLC is but an eye candy. To some, that is all that matters... a trophy to behold and to show off.\u00a0 \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

(but then again, Silver Arrow does command premium due to badge and resale), check any famous international auto youtube reviews, GLC is constantly ranked top /\u00a0if not best SUV right now ....\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI was at the GLC launch as well, it is really a nice car, no doubts, but still lacking a super WOW factor\u00a0like those\u00a0I will take out cheque book type of feeling...\nBUT if they are having a very good roadshow discount\u00a0/ or attractive overtrade - why not?\n\u00a0\nwaiting for GLC Coupe,,, that one I think will make my heart miss a beat :-)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited May 31, 2016 by rickosw\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I thought it was ok. Agree that the interior needs some refreshing (although they have recently change the gear knob to a better looking one). For exterior, Audi has always been conservative (not much difference from previous versions). The handling was not too bad either. Didn't bite due to the high mark up and low mileage warranty.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Explains the difference in the rear leg room vs the standard C-class...\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe GLC itself is a mishmash of Mercedes componentry, specifically the chassis and mechanical bits of the E-Class and the interior and electronics from the C-Class. We find this to be a particularly brilliant way to build a crossover. \u201cOne of the deciding factors for me was the decision to use the E-Class platform and C-Class features,\u201d Alisa Priddle said in explaining her vote. \u201cThat\u2019s the smart way to engineer a product.\u201d\nAdded guest judge Mike Accavitti: \u201cOverall, this is a great vehicle. You know you\u2019re getting into a Mercedes as soon as you open the door to the GLC. The quality of the materials and the elegance of the design are very consistent with the Mercedes-Benz brand proposition and reputation.\u201d\nThe platform itself is Mercedes\u2019 clever Modular Rear Architecture platform, which will eventually underpin 10 models, including the C- and E-Class and an upcoming replacement for the defunct R-Class. The GLC\u2019s 113.1-inch wheelbase nearly splits the difference between the 111.8-inch C-Class and the 115.7-inch E-Class. The length translates primarily into rear-seat space, including extra headroom when compared to a direct competitor such as the Cadillac XT5.\nA bunch of Germans I know joke that the GLC is the cheapest E-Class you can buy. They ain\u2019t joking.\n\nAs the GLC doesn\u2019t have the fancier interior of the E-Class, a bunch of Germans I know like to joke that it is the cheapest E-Class you can buy. Thing is, they ain\u2019t joking. The C-Class interior is the best in its class, and most folks couldn\u2019t tell it apart from an E-Class anyway. \u201cThis thing is just nice,\u201d Christian Seabaugh said. \u201cI hop in and immediately feel relaxed. The seats are sofa soft yet still supportive. All the touch points feel like a million bucks.\u201d Accavitti: \u201cIt\u2019s very luxurious looking with lots of leather and wood. I love how the infotainment system warns you not to be distracted by it, but then it has all these awesome screens you can\u2019t help be distracted by.\u201d Angus MacKenzie summed up the interior well: \u201cLooks rich and upscale, like a mini S-Class. It sets the benchmark for a small luxury SUV.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nhttps://www.google.com.sg/amp/www.motortrend.com/news/mercedes-benz-glc-class-2017-suv-of-the-year/amp/?client=ms-android-samsung\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

When you place your deposit,  it is stated clearly the only thibg confirmed is the selling price of the car without COE which is slightly less than 190k.When your car goes into factory production (about 3-4mth before expected delivery) ,  then they will package your car with coe. Usually not car price + coe premium.  There will be a 10-20 k off the premium.  It is not a discount but more like they already factored that 10-20k into ur car price. \nSince GLC is not ex-stock,  do not expect big carrots or discounts. \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I find the car looks more stylish than F10 (personal opinion), interior also looks nice and well built. Space wise about the same but bigger boot space. Good thing higher seating position, easy for folks to get in and out as well.

Was at both C&C and BM just yesterday so I remember the differences.\n\u00a0\nAs a Lexus owner myself, I prefer the NX for its luxury and high specs which contribute to the overall luxurious feel. Looks wise, it's ok but will be great if it's wider.\n\u00a0\nThe GLC looks damn good from the outside in AMG kit trim, which makes me continuously want to look at it. The interior is not bad, but doesn't feel as much luxurious. Artico is a let down. The glossy console is a fingerprint magnet. But the badge and current exclusivity makes it a worthwhile proposition too, along with potential resale.\n\u00a0\nAnyway it's my friend who is shortlisting this two.

That is,  if you can find a ready stock car specced to what you like and colour. If factory order via PI also offers more flexibility in the list you want to tick off but you risk PI running away before your car is being made. \n\u00a0\nAs what some bros here mentioned, CnC for peace of mind at a premium pricing.  PI if you have a very specific list of equipment that you want to tick off. \n\u00a0\nHow you want to spend your money is very individual.  No right or wrong just whether you go in having done your homework and your eyes wide open.\n\u00a0\nI also wish I can buy a GLC at PI price, with CnC warranty and reliability. \u00f0\nGood advice, unlike my colleague who just said \"got money to buy Merc, still wanna penny pinch by buying from PI meh... Very su seh leh\".\u00a0\nYeah he's a cbk haha\n\u00a0\nBut with all the recalls nowadays, going agent route will be safer.\n\u00a0\nOne business counterpart bought an A7 from PI 5 years ago, gearbox broke down after a year, out of warranty, spent 15k on repair and replacement :/\n\u00a0\nPI may give warranty but is their warranty really got \"pah kay\" anot?\n\u00a0\nFor b&b cars which are nice and not available at AD, like Harrier, ok la since it's attractively priced and lots of parts available.

As far as I know, BMW X3 is the reference for medium size luxury SUV.\n\n\u00a0\nActually, i think by suppressing supply in high demand area to avoid giving discounts thus increase margins per unit, i think is a smart move. The balance between inventory, production, demand and pricing is a fine balancing act. Producing too many and flood the inventory could potentially suppress pricing.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYou should be looking at the top line, i.e. revenue instead of\u00a0EBITDA or EBIT if you're focusing on sales volume. Many other factors affects the bottom line, and even EBIT. There maybe asset revaluation and impairment which affects the depreciation and amortization before you arrive at EBIT. For operating performance, look at EBITDA, and their inventory and PPE from the balance sheet. There is also forex exposure to look at in the P+L if their big sales volume are exposed to high currency volatility countries, which in 2016, happens to be UK with the high depreciation of GBP compared to EURO, which is Daimler's reporting currency.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

That question should have been asked before booking.\n\u00a0\nGLC is NOT the perfect car but it ticks the most items on my checklist for the car I want to drive. I will not go into the nitty gritty details...but these are some of the reasons why I did not choose the other models:\n\u00a0\nNX\n- fussy japanese style interior\n- aggressive manga type exterior looks\n- Perm FWD part time AWD\n- BM not sincere in retaining a former owner\n\u00a0\nold X3\n- dated austere interior although quality is there\n- handling while best in the class sacrifices comfort on long drives\n- dated exterior\n- stiff pricing from PML for EOL model\n- weakest engine X3 20i for almost the same money as the german competitor. the equivalent power output performance X3 28i is easily 50K more\n\u00a0\nold XC60\n- FWD\n- firm and crashy suspension\n- interior finish and quality mediocre\n- looks dated as well\n\u00a0\nLR Disco Sport\n- crap interior (design and fit and finish)....press on door panel can see the gap, creak and move kind\n- decent power from engine but unrefined\n\u00a0\nold Q5\n- decent handling\n- power adequate...but don't like all those PA gimmick of giving you power upgrades after car arrives singapore.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nF-pace\n- interior quality almost like LR Disco Sports....same parent company, not surprised\n- drive and handling is the best of all the candidate ( it might be competing with RX class instead)\n- 2L Diesel engine alhough quite alright...but the supercharged 3L petrol is the one to go for but that pricing is in the macan territory.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEnd of the day, except for the F-Pace, GLC is the latest to the party and it shows in the overall design \u00a0with trademark MB quality.\nGLC has always been viewed by many as just C-class on stilts but in fact the platform is a shortened E-class platform and is evident in the space it translate into.\n\u00a0\nDetractors can bring up many negative aspects of GLC (eg. the shorter rear bench thigh rest, the running boards obstructing ease of entry/exit, lack of carplay/GPS, lack of standard genuine leather)...but if you take a step back and look... are those things going to make or break a good car or is just nitpicking on an overall fine vehicle?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nHi Vratenza,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why you chose GLC amongst all the other models you mentioned above?

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nI think I mountain tortoise.....but after some time with the MB Intelligent LED Light System that comes standard on CnC GLC, I find it quite impressive!\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nhttp://techcenter.mercedes-benz.com/en/led_intelligent_light_system/detail.html\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe LED Intelligent Light System offers a variety of adaptive light functions which automatically adapt the headlamps to typical driving and weather situations.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLED headlamps are closer to the daylight colour spectrum than xenon headlamps, for example, and are less tiring for the driver's eyes. There is no need to change the bulbs for the whole life of the vehicle.\n\u00a0\nIndividual light functions:\n\u00a0\n\nCountry mode and motorway mode replace dipped beam headlamps. Country mode illuminates the verge on the vehicle side more brightly and extensively than standard halogen dipped headlamps do. At speeds above 90 km/h, motorway mode is automatically activated, expanding the driver's visibility in two stages: first the performance of the LEDs increases, illuminating the road and the verges better. Then, at speeds above 110 km/h the range of the lamps is increased without dazzling the oncoming traffic.\n\u00a0\nThe active light function swings the headlamps into bends by up to 15\u00b0, thus illuminating the road far better. This works in both dipped and full-beam mode.\n\u00a0\nThe cornering light function improves the illumination of the road on corners and tight bends. Above a certain steering wheel angle, a module with two LEDs per headlamp is automatically activated on the appropriate side.\n\u00a0\nThe extended foglamp reduces dazzle to the driver caused by light reflected by the fog and at the same time it illuminates the outer half of the road more brightly. To do so, the headlamp on the driver's side swings outwards by 8\u00b0 and the light cone is lowered. The function can be activated at speeds of up to 70 km/h. If the driver subsequently accelerates to a speed of over 100 km/h, the extended foglamp switches off.\n\u00a0\nThe rear lamps also have LED technology. In order not to dazzle following drivers, the brightness of the brake lamp varies according to the ambient light and is for example automatically dimmed at night at a red traffic light. In addition, together with the brake light, the surrounding light strips light up, further reducing the dazzling effect.\n\u00a0\nWhen the vehicle is stationary, the LED Intelligent Light System also provides the driver with improved comfort and safety: the \"coming home\" function is triggered by the key fob when the vehicle is opened or locked and lights the way to or from the vehicle.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

All modern diesels will have a DPF. Your choice has to do with how Oxides of Nitrogen are handled. Lighter weight cars can get by with a NOx storage catalyst (Golf and Jetta), while heavier vehicles need (Passat, Mercedes, etc.) require an SCR (Selective Catalytic Reduction) system. SCR systems require a Urea (AdBlue) injection system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both as previously stated. SCR systems do not require post combustion fuel injections, but they do require AdBlue injections.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\nSame for my BMW 216GT\u00a0and that's why I don't understand why some diesels need to put adblue whilst other don't?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\tEdited May 15, 2017 by Vratenza\n\t\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I am not sure if it is because of my 19\" RFT fitted for my option, my GLC seems to come with individual TPM sensors which shows each individual tire's pressure in kPa. I was surprised as I had always thought GLC comes with ABS based \"Software\" TPMS. Just discovered this yesterday though \n\u00a0\n2. CnC delivered the car with 290kPa pressure all round. I always thought the ride is pretty firm due to the 19\" RFT and the AMG Line suspension. Going to try reduce to 260kPa later to try if it improves the pliancy when travelling in slow speed along uneven surfaced roads.\n\u00a0\n3. As mentioned earlier, I like the AMG Line suspension, combined with the 4matic, going round the bends and swiping curve is very reassuring with tons of grip and body sway control. Highway speed straight road, the suspension absorbs the surface irregularity perfectly.The only niggle is at low speed going about at carpark speed, all the road imperfections and undulation are transmitted to the cabin, ie. not very pliant at low speed.\n\u00a0\n4. ILS. If you never own it, you will not miss it. But once you have it, it is hard to go back on the normal static HID/LED. The way it brightens up the road is day and night when I compared it to my previous car's HID. at least 50% brighter and further compared on the same stretch of dimly lit road I travel daily going home. The swivel of the beams towards where your steering is pointed along a curve road as well as the cornering light on 90 degrees turn improves safety by a large margin as I can see further up the intended path. Pedestrians also seem to be aware that my car is turning due to the \"unusual\" swivelling of the light towards them and they tend to wait for me to finish my turn instead of trying to run across while I am turning. Secondarily, the ILS headlamps just look more chio. \n\u00a0\n5. The driver seat of the GLC has one of the most adjustments I have come across, including a thigh support adjustment as well as lumbar support that can be adjusted 4 ways to get the support to the exact level along your lumbar spine. The downside to it is the side bolsters are too wide apart for the average asian male physique. During faster cornering and turns, can feel the sides of the lumbar region tending to slide to either side. Larger sized individual and AMDKs should have no problem with that.\n\u00a0\n6. The 2.0T mercedes engine is as smooth as any 4 potter TC engine you can get. Mated to the 9G-Tronic, the gear changes are almost imperceptible. There are occasions during low speed 1-2 gear change (eg, slowing down to almost a stop at traffic light and suddenly need to accelerate ast the light turned green) that result in a rougher than usual shift as it was caught flatfooted so to speak.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n7. The drive modes are surprisingly useful despite only able to change the engine/transmission response, the steering firmness, SSS and aircon mode. The Sports+ can be pretty aggressive and not meant for day to day kind of driving. My go to setting is set in Individual customizable mode where I just choose the same setting as Sports mode but just deactivate the SSS.\n\u00a0\n8. The start stop system in the GLC is crap to say the least. In our hot climate, the SSS can restart the engine within minutes from stopping as the interior temperature is detected to raise beyond a certain threshold. within a traffic light stop duration, I think there was quite a few times that it had to restart even before the traffic light turns green. Much much worse in traffic jams.\n\u00a0\nAnd the re-starting of the engine is quite perceptible (compared to say a 2009 Lexus GS450h, well it is a 3.5L V6 NA, so maybe it is unfair as comparison), such that after a few days of trying to see if I can live with it, I turned it off every time these days.\n\u00a0\n9. The road noise and sound insulation of the GLC is pretty good I must say. \u00a0And I am comparing it with the noise and road noise insulation of a Lexus GS hybrid running on 18\" rims. Just make sure the model you get comes with front side double-glazed window glass (some region do not have this double glaze glass).\n\u00a0\n10. CnC unit only specced with Audio 20 and not prewired for GPS/SD card. My SE threw in an after market GPS system that is touch screen operated (think they swapped out the original Audio 20 screen for a touch screen). Not the most intuitive but getting the hang of the operations and I can easily assess the items I want with the swivel knob pretty quickly after a while. The touchpad is alright but functions better as a palm rest while I use the swivel knob \n\u00a0\n11. The Audio 20 comes with only 1 CD slot, but I do no miss those multiCD changers since it comes wit 2X USB port accessible via the center armrest compartment. I got a 32gb low profile USB3.0 thumbdrive, transfer the whole of my iTune lbrary (12GB) into it and plugged it in and forget about it. The Audio 20 system is able to read the Chinese characters and also display the album cover for each of the songs as what appears on the iTune player on the PC/Mac.\n\u00a0\n12. The 2X USB ports are 0.5A specced, so charging modern day mobile phones and tablets are going to be a pain in the ass. So I advised to get those 2.1A cigerate lighter socket powered adapter for fast charging on the move.\n\u00a0\n13. The factory speaker setup is already quite sufficient, able to tune the base, treble and mids. Can adjust the staging as well but must say the staging effect is not as defined as my lexus mark levinson. This is very subjective though, your mileage might vary.\n\u00a0\n14. Cnc units comes with interior dash and door trim stitching. if you add the AMG Line option, the stitching is retained. The PI AMG Line units I saw, the stitchings are replaced by plain vanilla non-stitched surface. A step down in terms of luxury/quality feel. Those in the market please keep an eye out for that when shopping or negotiating.\n\u00a0\n15. The panoroof is a must especially if you have black on black interior with black roof liner. \u00a0How it opens up the space with simply unrolling the fabric shield can only be experienced in person.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n16. The running boards takes some getting use to but it does help in maybe preventing some potential dings as I saw most sedans have their door lower edge lower than the running boards level, not going help for SUVS/lorry/vans though. It is a boon for my kid to climb up and down the car on his own.\n\u00a0\n17. The amount of interior storage is huge. Just need to get a centre armrest compartment divider to organize the space better. The rear space without spare tire allows alot of inferequently used stuff to disappear from the boot, thereby freeing up a fully usable load carrying space. Love the fact that the tonneaue cover is retractable along a guide rail and can be stored under the floor board when not in use. Some SUVs in the market do not come with that function.\n\u00a0\n18. The hands-free booth opening is very reliable once you get the hang of the kicking motion required and where to kick.\n\u00a0\n19. have not tried auto-park feature yet.\n\u00a0\n20. Traffic light HOLD brake function is useful for the lazy right leg during city traffic and highway jams.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWill add on later if I thought of something. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

C Class would receive it end of this year/next year; GLC to follow suit in 2019? C class was introduced in 2014 vs GLC in end 2015.

The 9 gear ratio with it's closed spaced and wide spread allows the MB engineers to tune the 2.0T such that the max torque of 350nm arrives at 1200rpm. The engine vibration is well Insulated by the chassis sound damping and insulation. Front double glazed windows helps in no small part. Gear change is almost imperceptible and the only clue u have that the gear changed is the info cluster gear indicator and the raise/fall of the rpm. Gear 2 is uncharacteristically \"rougher\" than all the other gears but seem to improve after running in and the transmission learns the driving style.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe start stop system is not the smoothest.

Not an option.\n\u00a0\nAnyway I don't think I will miss Android Auto unless it allows screen mirroring of Waz/Google Maps.\n\u00a0\nWhatever VES rebate, it is just an opportunity for the AD/PI to increase their profit margin at your expense because 10 yrs down the road when your car is deregistered, you will pay the price. In the event that you don't drive the car for 10 yrs, your 2nd hand dealer will cream you off another round base on your paper value.\n\u00a0\nUntil the day the LTA wakes up it's idea, it is better to just buy a VES neutral vehicle with no hidden surprise.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nActually the smartphone integration (CarPlay/android) option is now available for c/glc on mb DE's website.Should be on add on option for C&C as well. Oh well, can't be added for my Sep/oct batch I reckonWell the tesla model 3 qualifies for ves rebate.

Non of the PI have the features in a single car I need in ready stock. It is impossible to find the ideal combination of features. Indenting through PI doesn't even begin to make sense at all.\n\u00a0\nAnd personally I feel that buying from PI is like buying a showroom/testdrive car. Hundreds of shoppers like me can go in, molest the car (even test drive I was offered) despite the car on display has a sold A4 paper on the windscreen. How do I know the car I am buying from them is not subjected to the same treatment awaiting my COE bidding?\n\u00a0\nFor me, when I signed on the dotted line at CnC, \u00a0I know I am paying extra 10-15K (spec for spec if can find a similar specced one from PI), yet need to wait for 7-8 months (I had plenty of time since my COE was not expiring anytime soon). To some 10-15K is too much to pay for peace of mind, I feel otherwise.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYes bro you got a point.It's caveat emptor really.I know where you're coming from...

Thus it explain why some PI car need to wait as I assume they indent & ship from HKG if their current stock ran out. Don't think they dare to bring in some many & keep as we approaching closer to 2018 ba.\n\u00a0\nIf those who can wait just wait, if not just buy GLC200 or PI GLC250 straight away so can drive the car soon. To me is about the delivery dates. Is really horrendous that C&C can't keep up with the demand I suppose. Keep waiting the facelift come out in 2019 Liao.....\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Perhaps I may consider BMW530 over GLC250.\nI tend to think that C&C take the ALMS (Ai Lai Mai Suah) approach as they do not lack of buyers for Merc.\n\nFor GLC especially I realise they do not really care. I think the delivery are too far therefore they tend not to waste Too much time on poaching customer to buy this model.

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nAgree that in lower powered car like the subaru TS AWD effect is not justified.\n\u00a0\nThe only way I figure how it contributes to the claimed safer feeling is the additional weight at the bottom of the chasis from the additional rear differentials combined with the low lying boxer engine makes the car's CG lower than the average 1.6l sedans. That makes it very stable going about bends and curves albeit slowly with the low hp.\n\u00a0\nEffective or not, can't really comment cos never driven one.\n\u00a0\nBut i can vouch for a 2.5T flat 4 boxer with AWD how much confidence it gives going about when wet slippery bends and curves.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nwell said.\n\u00a0\nBut the need for AWD is only apparent in slippery conditions or with a torquey and powerful engine.\n\u00a0\nAWD on especially the 100bhp 1.6 subaru impreza is over-rated and unnecessary in Singapore. its like a 4wd kei car in japan where it helps only on icy roads. Else its just added weight and drag. 100bhp just doesn't have the power to break traction to matter. yes we have wet roads but unless you fling the car and stab the pedal to the metal. even then i doubt 4wd with 100bhp help to power you out of danger.\nIMHO i find it odd that many says 4WD/AWD makes them feel safer in a 100bhp impreza. i just cannot fathom how so.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

AWD is def good to have but sometimes is really about psychological effect. Just like petrol 98 vs 95 ... I don't feel any diff leh (even my fren working inside also say feel not diff) but for sure there is a diff that's why got 2 category mah... And ya well said about appreciating it... Some like to spend on brands, some like to spend on liquor & beer. Those who drive many years I think given a AWD or a RWD car also can't feel the diff. Or maybe is only me... haha. My fren drove many cars b4, from Rex STI & many cars in btwn to current XT & wana change back to sedan never rave about the AWD in his XT and req another AWD in his nxt car.... \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I have yet to bring my car up north, as I think it might be more useful at higher speed and longer stretches of highway, so I have not been able to test it out personally.\n\u00a0\nWhen you are in manual mode (because you have previously down-shifted using the left paddle), and you want to hand the control back to the auto transmission, you can:\n1) pull and hold the right paddle for a short duration\nor\n2) tap the steering mounted gear shifter down (towards D) once\n\u00a0\n........and you will see that the Mx will change to Dx in your instrument panel.\n\u00a0\nPreviously I had always have to up-shift manually and wait for the AT to take over the reign after I was done with the manual down-shift to enter a bend at a slightly higher speed.\n\u00a0\nHope this information will find use for other GLC/Merc owners here.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Think nano coating is part of the package?Should I do it before taking delivery?SE said can do later as the new car will come polished already. Or should I do it before taking delivery to protect the original paint?Counting down after waiting for so many months :-)\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

City driving would be around your level (mine's around 12L/100km).\n\u00a0\nYes, the grrrr sound can be heard when accelerating from standstill. No vibration though.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

No need top grade, can last 1yr+ can already coz the disgusting bacteria build up from notes and coins turns me off n it\u2019s time for the incinerator. Watch whether its $100,000 or $100 tell the same time, unlike a car where the extra money goes into R&D, safety systems, crash testing, NVH, advanced electronics and not juz a marketing/branding exercise.

Cause compare price list is flat 30k difference man.. been eyeing this car for awhile..\nHave to clarify a bit...\u00a0\nIt\u2019s impossible to have a fair comparison as PI models come as it is, anything else is locally modified. For me, the price difference on paper was about $23k. However, the PI config varies and many can\u2019t really confirm the features until the car is shipped out of the ADs in UK or HK that they buy from. In general, I can\u2019t find these features which I value:\n1) Ambient lights - really nice feature\n2) side floor boards - some have some don\u2019t\n3) ILS LED lights - most PI model don\u2019t or can\u2019t confirm. Was told this is quite expensive.\n4) I wanted the 360 camera which I think is reasonable for $1,500 from AD. Very few PIs can offer this or have to do local install.\n5) $5k service credit from AD\n\u00a0\nSo, I estimate if I nego from PI down another $5k, gap would only be $15k. Rather subjective, I know. In the end, I would rather wait 6 months to get the exact config that I want then compromise. Tough long wait though. Mine is the GLC coupe btw.\n\u00a0\nWhen u say AMG, not sure what u mean. Coupe comes with the AMG kit... love the diamond grills! All cosmetics though... far away from the real AMG 43 and AMG 63.\n\u00a0\nHope this helps u make a better decision. COE has dropped a lot since I bought in June 2017, contrary to my prediction of higher COE prices. Hopefully, makes buying decision easier.\n\u00a0\nMaverick\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

But my brother bought his C180 from C&C and it's from South Africa and he had loads of electronic issues since he got his car 1.5 yrs ago and is constantly going back to C&C for troubleshooting. So it's either a quality problem from the factory or his bad luck got himself a lemon.\n\u00a0\nSecondly why i asked if C&C can only get their cars from South Africa is because if this is true, then that explains why the long wait for GLCs as compared to PI who can probably import their GLCs from other factories.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

I know different PIs have different specs which I will compared myself.

Spy photos reveal a lightly tweaked GLC luxury\u00a0crossover\u00a0SUV in testing. The main changes appear to be in the front fascia.Up front, the most obvious change is in the headlights. They have been changed to match the design set by the\u00a0CLS-Class\u00a0and\u00a0AMG GT\u00a0models. As such, the lower outside corners dip down, and the upper corners aren't as tall and upswept. Looking closer also reveals that the grille has also been revised. The bottom of the grille is a little smoother, and the outside corners have been stretched outward a bit.The rest of the car looks pretty much carryover. The taillights are covered up, which indicates that the lighting elements have likely been reworked, but any changes will be minimal. Otherwise, it's pretty much the same old\u00a0GLC-Class.Considering how mild a refresh this is, we would expect it to be fully revealed within a year, likely in time for the 2019 model year.Engines\u00a0will likely be carryover, which means the use of a turbocharged four-cylinder for the normal\u00a0GLC300\u00a0models and the\u00a0hybridGLC350e. There will almost certainly still be an\u00a0AMG\u00a0GLC43 with a twin-turbo V6 and an AMG GLC63 with a twin-turbo V8, too.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The cut out requirement of the vkool for the IU is already a hint to how the electro radio interference might be an issue.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nGood day Bro Vratenza,\n\u00a0\nYes, it will take approximately 6 months (or maybe more) to get the car on the road via indent basis.\u00a0 However, I feel it is worth the wait to have the car equipped with the options that I want direct from the factory.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nThank you for your concern and advice regarding making an indent purchase via PI.\u00a0 I myself have also thought long and hard about it.\u00a0 However after doing some research, I am pretty confident that the PI which I am gonna place an order will fulfill their end of the deal.\u00a0 This PI has been around for years and is pretty reputable.\u00a0 Moreover, who is to say and assure that C&C may not also just close shop one day?\u00a0 How can we forget the JP Morgan case a few years back?\u00a0 Or that AIA and Citibank once also faced bankruptcy if not for the intervention from governments? LOL\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nWhy I choose to make an indent purchase from a PI is because I feel that C&C is not interested in doing indent purchase.\u00a0 I spoke to a few of their SEs on different occasions and all of them look very disinterested to serve me after finding out that I may want to do an indent.\u00a0 Although there are many options one can choose to add onto their GLC250 based on the brochure from C&C, the SEs were quick to highlight that there are certain options which they are not keen to indent.\u00a0 One being the \"automatic panoramic sliding sunroof\".\u00a0 Some may say that it is silly to have the panoramic sunroof as one will seldom use it in such a hot country like Singapore.\u00a0 However since it is going to be my car and I am paying for it, should I not be the one to decide what I want?\u00a0 \n\u00a0\nLuckily, I got to know a SE from one of the PIs who is not only patient in listening to what I want.\u00a0 But he is also always ready to find out if he can get it for me and at what costs.\u00a0 Moreover, he is not pushy and he always attend to me with a superb attitude although I have been deliberating for months.\u00a0 He never once show any negative attitude even though I told him that I am still thinking and making comparisons with other PIs and C&C.\n\u00a0\nBack to the solar film:\u00a0 I understand that V-Kool uses the metallic splutter technology and so am concerned that it may affect cell phone reception or wireless devices.\u00a0 However, it is stated on V-Kool's website that it will have no effect on these devices.\u00a0 But I wonder if Bros who has V-Kool on their cars can share their experiences?\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n3M and Huber Optik utilizes ceramic technology in their solar films and these ceramic absorb the heat rather than reflecting it away.\u00a0 Hence, one may feel their window panes heating up if they are to touch it during a hot and sunny day.\n\u00a0\nI agree that I can always redo it if I am unhappy with the result of my choice.\u00a0 However, I will prefer to first make an informed decision rather than having to spend unnecessary time, money and effort in going down to the workshop later to replace it.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Don't want to risk that. (you can google \"GLC Crabbing\")\u00a0\n\u00a0\n295/40 shouldn't be a problem fitting but will have larger rolling diameter resulting in speedo under reading.\n\u00a0\nOverall I also have to balance all these factors:\n- lateral stability (wider the better)\n- rolling resistance (wider will be higher)\n- steering responsiveness (narrower contact patch more precise)\n- total wheel weight (rim+ tire) (heavier will increase unsprung weight leading to the lousier suspension performance and acceleration)\u00a0\n- running cost ( wider tires more expensive to change when worn)\u00a0\n- Common tire sizes (more common, wider choice of replacement brand and models)\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt is not exact science other than just satisfying the tire/rim spec calculator's recommended sizes. Alot is also trial and error along the way. I might have been wrong with my initial choice, as long as it is still safe to drive, I will learn from the current choice and hopefully improve on my tire/rim choice algorithm in the future.\u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut what\u2019s your wheels specs? 9x20 ET? 10x20 ET?

No warranty no nothing, nobody will buy esp for conti cars since repairs abt due after 3yrs mark.\n\u00a0\nSoo... just hug n love your e250 for a longer time.

Normally i was quoted double by car dealerHi Bro Thaiyotakamli,\u00a0\nActually, it is not true that the policy will be the same coming from the same insurer.  This is because certain dealers will have a special tie-up with their insurer to provide special policy unique to their own dealership.\n\u00a0\nFor example, I know a case whereby a dealer has tied up with a certain insurer such that policies taken from the dealer itself will allow owners to have their cars repaired at workshops of their own choice including back at the dealership itself. As long as the customers are to renew their insurance policies thru the dealer, they can bring the car back to the dealer for repair or other workshops of their choice for the first 10 years of the car.\n\u00a0\nHowever, one will not be able to get the same policy by directly approaching the insurer. The policy direct from the insurer maybe slightly cheaper but cars that are more than 2 years old can only go for repairs at the insurer's authorized workshops.\n\u00a0\nDue to the slight difference in policy's premium, most (if not all) car owners will choose to renew their car insurance policies thru the dealer.\n\u00a0\nI believe this is a strategic alliance between the dealer and the insurer. This is because car owners will definitely be lured by the fact that they can continue to go back to the dealer for repairs even when their cars are old. This is beneficial to the dealer as they will have a decent income from owners going back there for their repairs. As for the insurer, they will continue to have the owners of these cars getting their policies indirectly from them. If not, the insurer may lose these car owners to their competitors.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

If I choose to redeem it after 12 months , all in w penalty it works out to be around $2800.  \n\u00a0\nSo with $2800 interests vs all freebie ( GPS, Reverse cam , front + back car cam , floor map and essential pack consists of umbrella , wallet, key chain and backpack) ..... u win \nAgain , is my TAKE , my motto as always - To each his OWN\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Felt somewhat \"floaty\" though.  \n\u00a0\nVery cluttered steering wheel area with this switch and what not.  The \"mouse\" to control the screen would probably give me carpal tunnel syndrome!  \n\u00a0\nScreen interface looked like it was an after thought.  Load cover was rattling during the test drive.   Rear bench aircon was pathetic.    \n\u00a0\nOffered price was good but didn't sign on the dotted line because of the above.  \n\u00a0\nYour experience may vary.   \nwant to change your pole* wowo already?\u00a0\nwah \n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

There is a\u00a0hole\u00a0in the bottom left passenger side at the foot area which I discovered only about a month ago. I only discovered it after couple of month because the\u00a0hole\u00a0is right at the bottom floor area. Only about a month ago I discovered the\u00a0hole\u00a0by accident. See pic below.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI have already reported this to C&C when I brought the car for the 1st\u00a0servicing. It has been recorded by them but I have not brought it back again to do a followup.\n\u00a0\nWhat should I do? Is this because the car did not go through proper quality check? They said the car is manufactured from Germany. How can the quality of finishing be this bad?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nCan C& C compensate in any way?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNeed some advice as to what I can do.\n\u00a0\nRegards.\nHow do I show the pic??\u00a0\nHow do I show the pic??\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSeem like you are the only one thus far to complain about this mysterious\u00a0 hole in the footwell that seem to affect you and you only.

The other is the lexus hybrid.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe 9G tronic matches well with the engine tune such that it is almost stutter free. Only niggle is the 2nd gear can be abit rough relative to the whole range of gear forward motion.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nX3 was a good car, very firm ride and handling, but at the end of the life span, PML was very stuck up with the pricing and the base 20i model is anaemic to drive despite the good handling. The 25i was priced at a level which I decided that I still get spare change when I get the GLC250 with panoroof and amg line option... And a brand new platform.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTo be fair, he was just sharing his unfortunate issues with his GLC.But I guess some of his comments touched raw nerves in those who bought it or planning to.There's no need to be mean with name calling.Frankly, I liked the looks of the GLC 250 coupe, went for 2 test drives just to be sure,But didn't like the handling of the car.

Brilliant 4 wheel drive. Please,please i am not making any personal attack. I am only providing feedback on the experience of the GLC I have been owning for about a year. Please don't take me wrong. I am not undermining any people. Just providing feedback though negative about a machine which has no human attachment or sentiment.\u00a0\nJust worried that some uncivilized forum members might say Shit stirrer, or have doubts that I might be a retard.\n\u00a0\nDrove 10 years Subaru forester . Suspension and drive quality was very good. Smooth power delivery.No complain from the entire family. Only wear and tear of brakes and tyres after 3 years.\u00a0 Faults though few only started appearing after 4 years.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The other is the lexus hybrid. \n\u00a0\nThe 9G tronic matches well with the engine tune such that it is almost stutter free. Only niggle is the 2nd gear can be abit rough relative to the whole range of gear forward motion. \n\u00a0\nX3 was a good car, very firm ride and handling, but at the end of the life span, PML was very stuck up with the pricing and the base 20i model is anaemic to drive despite the good handling. The 25i was priced at a level which I decided that I still get spare change when I get the GLC250 with panoroof and amg line option... And a brand new platform.\n\n\u00a0\nFinally located your problem.. you did not test drive the Harry Turbo.

So, when I placed my order, tyre crabbing, brake squeel are part of what I have anticipated. All these are done before I even go for a test drive.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen I test drive, I test the accelerator response and gear changes, the drive modes, suspension, steering, turning and ease of parking. Road noise and weird noises are done with the radio off and SE asked to kindly stop taking for a while.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFit and finish, luggage and passenger space test can be done with the static showroom car.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAfter I confirmed my purchase, I paid for and installed the factory workshop manual/parts software for mercedes cars. That's how I know how to DIY change my fender trims, front grill and door speakers.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDespite all that, I have to still deal with slowing system clock (pending me sending car in to flash software) and radiator temperature error code which C&C resolved. All these are part and parcel of owning a car. My lexus GS450h also developed hybrid system issue in 4th year while under extended warranty. Does it make it a crap car? No.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAgree fully about all cars will have their pros and cons. Some of the pros might be cons for others.

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nThe reason for considering this staggered tyres on square rims setup?\n\u00a0\nIf for looks, the rear staggered (9J vs 8.5J) usually means the 9J rim face is deeper set (ie. deep dish effect) and the rims are usually pushed out abit more (offset play). That is the look that staggered rims achieve when looking from the side and quadrant view. So, using a wider tyre on square rims at the rear will not achieve this effect.\n\u00a0\nof course from the rear, the wider tyre width will look broader and means business.\n\u00a0\nMaybe you can consider using the square rims with square tyres and just add a good quality\u00a0 H&R Spacer 20-25mm in the rear. That way you pushes out your rear track width, achieve a staggered look and will feel the improvement in lateral stability and cornering road holding.\n\u00a0\nJust a suggestion for you to consider.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nI on the other hand, am thinking of using staggered tyres on a square setup.All rims at 8.5J but front running 225 or 235 and rear running 255.Cos there's ex stock for 8.5J but none for 9J.

Seems like we've heard this before, but this time it's\u00a0Mercedes, not Porsche, that's claimed the crown.\nNot the outright lap record, or even the record for the fastest production car, but for the fastest production SUV ever to round the Nordschleife. And that honor now belongs to the\u00a0Mercedes-AMG GLC\u00a063 S, which managed the long and winding journey in 7 minutes and 49.369 seconds.\nThat, for those keeping score, is over two seconds quicker than the\u00a0Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifogliothat has held the record until now, having lapped the infamous circuit in 7:51.7 last year. And it's nearly two minutes faster than the\u00a0Skoda Kodiaq RS\u00a0that claimed the record for the fastest seven-seater this past summer.\nThe production SUV category isn't the first such crown that Mercedes has claimed, after its\u00a0GT 63 S four-door coupe\u00a0rounded the 'Ring in 7:25.41 just last month to claim the record for the fastest four-seater (even though it's slower than the\u00a0Jaguar XE SV Project 8).\nhttps://youtu.be/_dzBY8KAbKA\nAs for Benz's cross-town rival, the fastest one of its SUVs has ever lapped the Nordschleife was 7:59.74, set three years ago in a Cayenne Turbo S. But Porsche is still the undisputed King of the Ring, holding not only the outright record with its\u00a0919 Evo\u00a0prototype, but the production-car record as well with the\u00a0911 GT2 RS\u00a0\u2013 though the pundits (and its own sister company\u00a0Lamborghini) have a thing or two to say about that, since the car was modified by Manthey-Racing.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

One other way is to 3D print your own I guess. I ended up putting it in the middle of the centre console armrest after getting it lifted up with the tray which you can get for less than $10 from Aliexpress. That one works for all LHD and RHD cars. A little inconvenient to open it and remove/insert phone each time though.\u00a0\nDid u check amazon?

Like its predecessors, the SUV combines outstanding on- and off-road driving characteristics with spaciousness, practicality and comfort. In addition, the latest generation adds further advanced pioneering technologies, distinctive design, connectivity and state-of-the-art infotainment. Thus, the GLC once more demonstrates how elegantly and effortlessly hallmark brand safety and intelligent adaptability can be combined to great success. The result is an SUV that sets new standards, on the road as well as in terrain.\n\u00a0\nWith its distinctive appearance, innovative driving assistance systems and a new range of engines, the GLC offers the best from Mercedes-Benz. The exterior design offers a wide and sporty visual appearance. Muscularly sculpted surfaces and distinctive details such as the chrome elements, which now run from the front to the rear end as standard, the redesigned headlamps and the heavily contoured radiator grille ensure a strong off-road character. The interior combines luxury and user-friendliness in an uncompromising way: The workmanship is at a high level and the infotainment system has larger touchscreen multimedia displays. In addition, the latest generation of the MBUX - Mercedes-Benz User Experience multimedia system offers intuitive and versatile operating options such as touch, gesture control and the optimised voice control system. The driving assistance systems were considerably expanded and complemented with the exit warning function, the emergency corridor function and the tail end of a traffic jam function, among others. Also new is Trailer Manoeuvring Assist, which provides assistance with manoeuvring in reverse in particular. For the market launch in mid-2019, the Mercedes-Benz GLC will be equipped with new petrol and diesel engines of the latest engine family from Mercedes-Benz with more output and greater efficiency - more engines will follow later in the year.\n\u00a0\n\nThe most important advancements of the GLC\n\u00a0\nMBUX - Innovative telematics: The combination of the touchscreen multimedia displays, navigation with augmented reality, intelligent voice control via the talk button or the \"Hey Mercedes\" prompt, connectivity and the user interface now brings the GLC in line with the latest technological standards.\nDrive system: The GLC will be equipped with the next generation of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines with increased output at significantly lower fuel consumption - particularly on the petrol engines thanks to the new 48-volt on-board electrical system with belt-driven starter-generator.\nAdvanced assistance systems: Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC and Active Steer Assist provide even more support to help the driver to steer and to keep a safe distance. The speed is adjusted automatically ahead of bends or junctions. Active Steer Assist helps with forming an emergency corridor and with changing lanes. The risk of potential collisions can be reduced by the turn-off function of Active Brake Assist by braking if the driver fails to see oncoming traffic.\nExterior design: distinctive appearance\n\u00a0\nModernity, strength and versatility: this is what the design of the GLC embodies. The design idiom of the GLC follows the design philosophy of sensual purity and illustrates the carefully considered interplay of aesthetics, agility and intelligence. The appearance is sportier overall, the chrome elements now run from the front to the rear end as standard. The distinctive lines, muscularly sculpted surfaces and distinctive details ensure a strong off-road character. The front end gives the impression of emotion, presence and dominance at the very first glance. This design message is made particularly memorable by the standard-fit LED High-Performance headlamps with the torch-design daytime running lights, as well as by the heavily contoured radiator grille with the dynamically shaped double louvres and the diamond lattice. The available paint colours now include graphite grey - with four flush aerodynamic wheels with diameters ranging from 17 to 19 inches and tyres with optimised rolling resistance being another new addition.\n\u00a0\nThe AMG Line impressively emphasises the dynamic appearance of the Mercedes-Benz GLC - with the chromed diamond grille and the front apron with the AMG-specific design as well as with angular exhaust tips integrated into the bumper. In addition to sport seats with high side bolsters, this design and equipment line also includes the optimal mixed-size tyres from 19 to 20 inches in diameter (depending on the market).\n\u00a0\nThe standard-fit LED High-Performance headlamps are smaller and more raked, and have significantly modified contours: The torch shape of the daytime running lights hones the design and guarantees better recognisability of the Mercedes-Benz light signature. A full-LED headlamp with MULTIBEAM technology is optionally available.\n\u00a0\nThe athletic character continues in the rear view with the completely revised bumper and exhaust tips. The redesigned full LED tail lamps also ensure an unmistakable light signature - with the hallmark blocks of the Mercedes-Benz SUVs in backlit edge-light specification. All in all, the design idiom of the rear end underscores the powerful character of the GLC generation, not least because of the design of the bumper with the exhaust tips and the chromed skid plate sporting the typical SUV design.\n\u00a0\nInterior design: intelligence meets ergonomics\n\u00a0\nRefined materials, precision workmanship and flowing shapes - this is what characterises the interior of the GLC. The interior of the Base Line is finished in black. The centre console features an elegant trim component, which is available in piano lacquer finish or the two new wood surface finishes - open-pore ash wood and walnut. The lines of the wood veneers in the centre console exemplify supreme craftsmanship.\n\u00a0\nThe multifunction steering wheel is available in two versions and has been completely revised. Its distinctive spoke design conveys even more sporty character. In addition, its operation of Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC and the Touch Control buttons for controlling the instrument cluster and the multimedia system as well as the acoustic input feedback, send a clear signal pointing to the future.\n\u00a0\nThe user operates the telematics functions using single-finger and multi-finger gestures, so-called multi-touch control, on the multifunction touchpad on the centre console. It serves as an alternative to voice control and in addition offers the possibility to enter letters, numbers or special characters manually. The touchpad surface not only provides a clear haptic, but also an acoustic feedback.\n\u00a0\nENERGIZING comfort control: convenient interlinking\n\u00a0\nThe optional ENERGIZING comfort control ensures that various systems in the vehicle combine forces to create an optimal environment. This integrates lighting and musical atmospheres, climate control, suitable music and video selections as well as massage function, heating and ventilation of the seats. The ENERGIZING COACH uses data from the vehicle and surroundings to recommend one of the programmes that fits the situation and the individual. With the help of a suitable Garmin\u00ae wearable, personal scores such as the stress level or the quality of sleep make the recommendation more precise.\n\u00a0\nMBUX: intuitive operation\n\u00a0\nWell thought-out, ergonomic, comfortable - these guidelines governed the advancement of the operating and display concepts used in the Mercedes-Benz GLC. The focus is on the interaction with the vehicle and its functions through gestures, touch or the voice control system. This is made possible by the latest telematics generation of the Mercedes-Benz User Experience, which is characterised by intuitive logic and a wide range of operating options. Overall, the interplay of the touchscreen displays, the navigation with augmented reality, the intelligent voice control and the user interface sets real standards.\n\u00a0\nThere are a total of five different possibilities to interact with the infotainment system of the GLC:\nVia Touch control on the multimedia display in the centre\nUsing the Touch Control buttons on the multifunction steering wheel\nWith the multifunction touchpad on the centre console\nUsing gesture control with the interior assistant\nBy voice control, either with the talk button on the steering wheel or the \"Hey Mercedes\" prompt\nThe information the driver needs is shown on two high-resolution displays. Optionally, the instrument cluster measures 12.3 inches. The free-standing multimedia display in the centre is available in 10.25 inches with 1920 x 720 pixels. The driver can choose from three individual representations to suit the mood or the interior: \"Classic\" is an advancement of a classic display, \"Sport\" presents a high-contrast high-tech look, \"Progressive\" visualises modernity in reduced form. The graphics in brilliant quality underscore the comprehensibility of the intuitive operating structure. New additions are the touch sensitivity of the multimedia display - and the Touch Control buttons on the multifunction steering wheel for operating the instrument cluster and the multimedia system.\n\u00a0\nAnother effortless way of operating the multimedia system is the Interior Assistant. A camera in the overhead control panel captures the movements of the hand as it approaches the touchscreen or the touchpad on the centre console. The system makes a distinction between the gestures of the driver and the front passenger, which changes the image on the media display accordingly by highlighting or enlarging individual elements. The reading spot also can be switched on and off by hand control. To this end, the light in the overhead control panel follows the movement when the driver is looking for something on the front-passenger seat, for example. In addition, there is the option of operating a favourite function of the multimedia system by a specific gesture that was stored previously.\n\u00a0\nAnother highlight in conjunction with MBUX is the Augmented Video optional extra, which complements the navigation in a useful way. A camera in front of the rear-view mirror captures the surroundings and automatically shows information on the multimedia display that complements the video image. This includes traffic signs, information about where to make a turn, house numbers or names. This makes orientation - such as the search for a given address- quite a bit easier.\n\u00a0\nThe revised voice control system makes operation even more convenient and natural. By voice command, the driver can have the system read out text messages, operate the audio systems or access vehicle functions such as the climate control system, for example. The system requires no memorised commands - the user has the freedom, for example, to phrase the desired destination address or the question about the weather report off-the-cuff. The driver can now activate the voice control with the \"Hey Mercedes\" prompt and the talk button on the steering wheel is additionally available for this purpose.\n\u00a0\nNew features in the GLC are the standard-fit KEYLESS GO start function using the turbine-look start-stop button and the option to activate driver assistance systems on the multimedia display. The user selects and activates the drive modes via the DYNAMIC SELECT switch on the centre console. The multimedia display shows different drive modes in line with the particular equipment. The driver can select from different pre-configured and one individual drive mode. Depending on the powertrain and the suspension variant, between five and seven drive modes are available. In addition to \"Comfort\", \"ECO\", \"Sport\", \"Sport +\" and \"Individual\" for customising the steering, the suspension or the powertrain, the Off-Road Engineering Package offers the two modes \"Off-Road\" and \"Off-Road +\".\n\u00a0\nThe new range of engines: powerful efficiency\n\u00a0\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLC will be equipped with the next generation of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. The crucial feature of the M 264 two-litre four-cylinder engine from Mercedes-Benz is the increased output at significantly lower fuel consumption. In the GLC 300, the M 264 four-cylinder engine replaces the M 274 predecessor engine, the OM 654 four-cylinder diesel engine replaces the OM 651 predecessor engine.\n\u00a0\nThe new engine generation is of great importance for reducing CO2 emissions and is a systematic advancement with regard to lowering consumption. The main technology components are CAMTRONIC variable valve control, which heats up the exhaust system without driving up consumption, the twin scroll turbocharger and the additional 48-volt system with belt-driven starter-generator. The combination of the 48-volt on-board power supply and belt-driven starter-generator increases the agility, improves the comfort characteristics - and significantly lowers the fuel consumption. This is made possible by the system permitting important hybrid functions such as \"energy recovery\", \"boost\" and \"sailing mode\" without high-voltage components - to be more specific, boosting, recovering up to 10 kW of energy (in the rev range up to 2500 rpm) and operating in sailing mode with the engine switched off.\n\u00a0\nStricter requirements and lower limit values - the four-cylinder OM 654 diesel engine is designed with an eye on further decreasing consumption and emissions as well as lowering operating costs and improving engine output.\n\u00a0\nThe most important components of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system are directly mounted on the engine for efficiently reducing emissions. In addition, measures for heat insulation and further developed coatings such as SCR technology (Selective Catalytic Reduction) cause an additional decrease in emissions. To reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions further under higher loads, the OM 654 is equipped with an additional underfloor SCR catalyst. As a result, the engine today already complies with the RDE (Real Drive Emissions) requirements.\n\u00a0\nThe OM 654 four-cylinder diesel engine is combined with 4MATIC all-wheel drive and the 9G-TRONIC automatic transmission, which supports both a dynamic and a fuel-saving driving style.\n\u00a0\nDYNAMIC BODY CONTROL: suspension made to measure\n\u00a0\nWith the model update, the GLC is for the first time equipped with the DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL suspension with infinitely adjustable dampers for the front and rear axle. Depending on the driving situation, speed and condition of the road, the damping is controlled individually for each wheel in interaction with the engine, transmission and steering characteristics. In addition, the suspension can be combined with a sport steering system with a more direct steering ratio. It is operated with the DYNAMIC SELECT switch and offers three selectable stages: The two stages \"Sport\" and \"Sport +\" deliver a firmer set-up of the damper characteristics, while \"Comfort\" mode provides an especially comfortable ride.\n\u00a0\nDYNAMIC SELECT: more than a setting\n\u00a0\nAn SUV that lives up to its name: As usual, the Mercedes-Benz GLC is convincing on almost any type of ground and in the most adverse weather conditions. The new controls of the Off-Road Engineering Package (not available in the UK) and the DYNAMIC SELECT system with expanded functions according to the specification responds to the individual requests of the driver with regard to the handling and the requirements posed by the particular road conditions. The driver selects between the two off-road drive modes with the DYNAMIC SELECT switch on the centre console: The \"Off-Road\" mode is particularly suited for dirt roads, gravel, sand and snow, while the \"Off-Road +\" mode is perfect for difficult terrain with rocky or steep slopes. The 4MATIC all-wheel drive was newly developed from the ground up. The three-stage design of ESP\u00ae with a wider spread now offers even more dynamics in the \"Sport\" and \"Sport +\" drive modes. The GLC thus once again proves its versatility - off-road as well.\n\u00a0\nDriving assistance systems: safe support\n\u00a0\nIn Germany, 85 percent of customers cite \"safe\" as the top characteristic when it comes to the GLC - and besides the typical SUV traits, this is due to the intelligent driving assistance systems. The scope and level in the new model have been increased further still and the driver support with regard to safety and comfort thereby further enhanced. The Driving Assistance Package (optional extra) in the GLC includes among other things:\n\u00a0\nActive Distance Assist DISTRONIC with the functions:\nBraking for stationary objects\nExpanded automatic restarting in a traffic jam in conjunction with Active Parking Assist (internal designation) and navigation\nActivation of \"sailing mode\" in ECO drive mode\nActive Steer Assist with the functions:\nActive Emergency Stop Assist - with automatic unlocking and sending of an SOS call to the MB Emergency Call Centre after vehicle comes to a stop (depending on the country)\nActive Lane Change Assist in conjunction with navigation\nEmergency corridor function: In traffic jams on motorways at speeds below 60 km/h\nActive Speed Limit Assist with response to change in speed limit in conjunction with Traffic Sign Assist\nRoute-based speed adjustment ahead of bends, roundabouts, toll plazas, T-junctions as well as before making a turn/exiting motorways/expressways - reduction of vehicle speed also for route event \"tail end of traffic jam\", in conjunction with navigation\nEvasive Steering Assist\nActive Lane Keeping Assist\nActive Blind Spot Assist\nActive Brake Assist with turn-off and cross-traffic function\nPRE-SAFE\u00ae PLUS\nWhen Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC with route-based speed adaptation is activated, the new Mercedes-Benz GLC is able to recognise and respond to traffic jams or slow-moving traffic with the help of information from LiveTraffic before the driver becomes aware of this traffic obstruction. When a traffic jam is detected (and if the driver does not choose a different response), DISTRONIC reduces the speed to around 62.5 mpg (100 km/h) as a precaution. This is complemented by an improved Active Lane Keeping Assist as well as by additional functions of Active Emergency Stop Assist.\n\u00a0\nActive Braking Assist (standard in the UK) with tail end of traffic jam emergency braking function, turn-off and cross-traffic function reduces the risk of a potential accident when making a turn, for example, if the driver fails to see oncoming vehicles. If there is a danger of a collision with oncoming traffic when making a turn across the road, the GLC can be braked at the speeds typical of such manoeuvres. Braking intervention takes place if the driver signals the intention to make a turn and the vehicle can be braked to a stop before crossing the lane markings. Oncoming vehicles are detected by the long-range radar sensor in the front and the stereo multi-purpose camera.\n\u00a0\nActive Steer Assist even helps the driver with forming an emergency corridor on multi-lane roads. As per statutory requirements, for orientation the vehicle uses the edge of the lane depending on the lane and on motorways below 37.5 mph the surroundings as well as detected lane markings.\n\u00a0\nAlso possible is the simplified overtaking manoeuvre with activated Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC: When the driver activates the turn indicator at speeds between 50 mph and 112 mph on multi-lane roads, Active Lane Change Assist can help with changing lanes.\n\u00a0\nThe exit warning function reduces the risk of failing to see an approaching vehicle or a cyclist when opening the door. The exit warning function is only active when the vehicle is stopped. When the driver or a passenger opens the door and a vehicle is approaching, the system emits a visual and audible warning. The function is active for up to three minutes after switching off the engine. In conjunction with the ambient light, the lights of the door handle recess, the map pocket and the trim illumination flashes red in addition.\n\u00a0\nAs an option, Active Parking Assist is available. After pushing the button for Active Parking Assist, the system shows all identified parking spaces in the immediate surroundings on the multimedia display at speeds below 22 mph. The driver selects the parking manoeuvre as such with the touchpad, the touchscreen of the multimedia system or the right-hand control panel of the multifunction steering wheel - the system provides assisted pulling and reversing into and out of a parallel and end-on parking spaces.\n\u00a0\nIn combination with Blind Spot Assist, Parking Assist PARKTRONIC can warn the driver of cross-traffic when reversing out of end-on parking spaces, and also initiate automatic braking if necessary. Parking Assist PARKTRONIC gives a visual and acoustic warning of obstacles detected by means of six ultrasound sensors in each bumper. These can be in front of, to the side or behind the vehicle, and are detected at speeds up to approx. 6mph.\n\u00a0\nAnother highlight is the optional Trailer Manoeuvring Assist, which supports the driver with manoeuvring in reverse. The system uses sensors in the ball head and a magnetic ring to measure the angle between towing vehicle and trailer. The 360-degree camera offers a better all-round view when parking and manoeuvring as well as a virtual bird's-eye view. An additional zoom mode facilitates approaching and hooking up the trailer, the image on the multimedia display features a new animation and the picture quality has been significantly improved.\n\u00a0\nCar-to-X communication supports the driver by providing them with up-to-date information and warnings of hazardous situations on the road. The radio-based exchange between vehicles as well as between vehicles and the traffic infrastructure informs the driver visually and/or acoustically of potential hazards.\n\u00a0\nStrength. Driven by dedication\n\u00a0\nThe new generation of the GLC marks the start of a new chapter in a true success story: The model sold significantly better than its predecessor in its first full year on the market. At present, Mercedes-Benz has a very successful presence in the SUV segment with seven models (GLA, GLC, GLC Coup\u00e9, GLE, GLE Coup\u00e9, GLS, G-Class). There is no doubt about it: The SUVs play an essential role in the product range of the brand and its success. More than five million SUVs from Mercedes-Benz were delivered to customers worldwide to date.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The next generation of the successful model skilfully and intricately combines the sportiness of a coup\u00e9 with the functionality of an SUV. The result is a vehicle for individualists who attach maximum importance to extraordinary looks, the greatest possible freedom and pioneering technology. Innovative technologies, intelligent driving assistance systems and a new engine line-up make the Coup\u00e9 a paragon of sportiness, safety and efficiency.\n\u00a0\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 impresses with its distinctive appearance, innovative driving assistance systems, a new engine line-up and the latest generation of the MBUX Mercedes-Benz User Experience infotainment system with its wide range of control options. The enhanced driving assistance systems have been expanded by adding an exit-warning function, emergency-corridor function and tail-end-of-traffic-jam function, among others. Also new is Trailer Manoeuvring Assist, which provides assistance when manoeuvring in reverse.\n\u00a0\nMesmerising coup\u00e9 rear: elegant exterior design\n\u00a0\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 is characterised by its dynamic appearance and elegant lines. Hallmark off-road features include the dominant front end, powerful forms and standard-fit chrome details like the front and rear underride guards. Its coup\u00e9 character shines through in the squat silhouette with the dropping roof line and rounded rear window. Highlights at the front end include the powerfully contoured diamond radiator grille with integrated star and single louvre typical of a coup\u00e9, complemented by the distinctive air intakes and the new contours of the standard-fit LED High Performance headlamps.\n\u00a0\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 shows how the design features of a coup\u00e9 can be harmonised with those of an SUV with its dropping roof line, the greenhouse that fits perfectly into the silhouette and the feature line in combination with the eye-catching chrome strip on the high beltline, the muscular shoulders and the rearwards-ascending light-catching contour. On top of this, the dynamic proportions and the generous ground clearance emphasise the GLC Coup\u00e9's range of abilities - it's just at home on smooth tarmac as it is on a dirt track.\n\u00a0\nIntelligence and convenience: the interior\n\u00a0\nFlawless luxury and user-friendly controls abound in the Coup\u00e9's interior. As is usual for Mercedes-Benz, particular importance is given to the interior. The focus is on the dashboard and the flowing lines of the centre console. The large, one-piece console panel sweeps elegantly from the centre air vents to the armrest. It has a premium feel and a build quality of exceptionally high calibre. The interior colour magma grey is completely new. The completely revised multifunction steering wheel is available in two versions. Its operation of Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC and the Touch Control buttons for controlling the instrument cluster and the infotainment system as well as the acoustic input feedback set new standards.\n\u00a0\nThe multifunctional touchpad on the centre console improves operating convenience even further, and replaces the rotary pushbutton, while the infotainment system has larger touchscreen displays with 12.3 inches in the instrument cluster plus 7 inches with 960 x 540 pixels and 10.25 inches with 1920 x 720 pixels in the central display. In addition to this, the latest generation of the MBUX Mercedes-Benz User Experience infotainment system boasts intuitive logic and a wide range of control options. There are five different ways to interact with the GLC's infotainment system:\n\u00a0\nBy touch control on the central display\nUsing the Touch Control buttons on the multifunction steering wheel\nWith the multifunction touchpad on the centre console\nVia optional gesture control with the Interior Assistant\nBy voice control, using the \"Hey Mercedes\" prompt\n\u00a0\nThe optional ENERGIZING comfort control combines various in-vehicle systems to create an optimum environment. This integrates lighting and music moods, climate control, suitable music and video selections as well as a massage function, heating and ventilation for the seats. The ENERGIZING COACH uses data from the vehicle and surroundings to recommend one of the programmes that fits the situation and the individual.\n\u00a0\nThe state-of-the-art driving assistance systems are augmented by the exit-warning function, emergency-corridor function and tail-end-of-traffic-jam function, among others. New features include Trailer Manoeuvring Assist, which provides assistance when manoeuvring in reverse. The system uses sensors in the ball head and a magnetic ring to measure the angle between towing vehicle and trailer. The 360\u00b0 camera offers good all-round visibility and a greatly enhanced image on the display.\n\u00a0\nIncreased efficiency: the new engines\n\u00a0\nAt market launch the Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 will be available with new engines, with further engines to be added to the line-up during the course of the year. All the diesel models already meet the requirements of the Euro 6d standard (RDE - Real Driving Emissions Stage 2), which comes into force in 2020. This is achieved thanks to the insulated configuration of the exhaust-gas aftertreatment system installed directly on the engine. It consists of diesel oxidation catalytic converter (DOC), particulate filter with SCR catalytic converter function (sDPF) and SCR catalytic converter with AdBlue\u00ae injection. The system is augmented by an additional selective catalytic reduction (SCR) converter with an ammonia slip catalyst (ASC) in the exhaust tract of the GLC. The petrol engines are electrified by the integration of a 48-volt on-board electrical system (EQ Boost). The belt-driven starter-generator is responsible for hybrid functions such as boost or energy recuperation, while allowing fuel savings that were previously the reserve of high-voltage hybrid technology. In addition to reducing consumption and CO2 emissions, the technology also enhances both comfort and performance.\n\u00a0\nExpressive design: The stylish appearance of the new Coup\u00e9 generation encapsulates the Sensual Purity design philosophy and combines the flexibility of an SUV with the sense of style and sportiness of a coup\u00e9. The A-pillars have a more pronounced slope, which lowers the roof silhouette. The model owes much of its extraordinary character to the diamond radiator grille, which is available in silver as standard or black in conjunction with the Night package, featuring a chrome trim incorporating formal elements of the underride guard. Further eye-catching features include the standard-fit LED High Performance headlamps with their torch design and unmistakable light signature. The elegant lines are drawn to a successful conclusion by the compact rear end featuring a new-look diffuser with underride guard and tailpipe trims as well as full-LED tail lamps.\n\u00a0\nMBUX - Innovative telematics: The combination of the touchscreen displays, navigation with augmented reality, intelligent voice control via the talk button or the \"Hey Mercedes\" prompt, connectivity and the user interface makes the GLC Coup\u00e9 state of the art.\n\u00a0\nSuspension: As an alternative to the standard sports suspension with adaptive damping, DYNAMIC BODY CONTROL with infinitely adjustable dampers for the steel springs on the front and rear axle is available as an option. Depending on the driving situation, speed and condition of the road, the damping is controlled individually for each wheel in interaction with the engine, transmission and steering characteristics. AIR BODY CONTROL air suspension is also available - to further enhance comfort and sportiness.\n\u00a0\nAdvanced assistance systems: Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC and Active Steer Assist provide even more comfortable support to help the driver to keep a safe distance and steer. The speed is adjusted automatically ahead of bends or junctions. Active Steer Assist helps with forming an emergency corridor and with changing lanes. The risk of potential collisions can be reduced by the turn-off function of Active Brake Assist by braking if the driver fails to see oncoming traffic.\n\u00a0\nDrive system: The Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 comes with a choice of efficient four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines from the latest generation. The diesel engines already meet the requirements of the Euro 6d standard. The petrol engines are electrified by the integration of a 48-volt on-board electrical system (EQ Boost).\n\u00a0\nThe new-generation Mercedes-Benz GLC Coup\u00e9 is a blend of exceptional and sophisticated features, further underlining its leading position with this combination of style and ability. At present, Mercedes-Benz has a very successful presence in the SUV segment with seven models (GLA, GLC, GLC Coup\u00e9, GLE, GLE Coup\u00e9, GLS, G-Class).\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

As long as the problem is recifiable by AD, it is all part of ownership.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMay I propose that once you get your car back from C&C, we can have a meetup, I let you test my car and you let me experience in person your long list of issues with your ride.\n\u00a0\nThe invitation is on the table.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nHi Vratenza,\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0It has been quite a while. Unfortunately I am still living with the wobbly, juddery drive of my GLC. If you don't mind as you have offered, perhaps we can meet up and you can test drive my car and provide a second opinion. I am not sure if this is indeed the nature of this model or it is an issue only with my car. Please do let me know where and when we can meet. Thanks.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Moreover, the driver can easily adjust the impressive listening experience to his or her personal taste. The switchable surround function creates a virtual surround sound from mono and stereo signals to make the interior of the Mercedes-Benz GLC seem acoustically even bigger if there are no true 5.1 multi-channel recordings available. By means of the front/all/rear optimisation the passengers can adjust the sound specifically for the front, rear or all seats. A punchy bass reproduction is guaranteed by the Frontbass technology: here the woofers are integrated into the car body in front of the passengers.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

The specs given for GLC250 is around 7L per 100km and maybe for urban driving about 8.5L per 100km. Factor in heavy footed driving probably 9.5L per 100km. So far most of the time I am only able to achieve on average 13L to 14L per 100km and that is light footed driving in ECO mode. My car is stock with no mods to the ECU and less than 5000km mileage.\n\u00a0\nI use shell 98 fuel and 19 inch wheels.\n\u00a0\nHaving driven C and E class, the specs and actual fuel consumption doesn't differ that much. \n\u00a0\nAppreciate some thoughts why actual fuel consumption is so much difference compared to on paper.\n\u00a0\nThanks\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
