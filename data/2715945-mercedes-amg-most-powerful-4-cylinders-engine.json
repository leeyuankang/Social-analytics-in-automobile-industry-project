Power per liter sits at an impressive 208 hp, making this the most powerful mass-production four-cylinder road car engine ever.\n\u00a0\nCompared to the M133 that powered the previous-gen AMG 45, the M139 has been flipped 180 degrees, with the turbocharger and exhaust manifold now facing backwards. The turbo also features roller bearings and the engine incorporates an improved exhaust manifold helping to prevent individual cylinders from negatively influencing one another during load cycles, while it runs on 0W20 oil (!) and still needs servicing every 20,000 miles or once a year, whatever comes first...\n\u00a0\nProducing a turbocharged four-cylinder engine with so much power is an impressive feat, made possible by numerous upgrades that range from new oil- and water-cooling systems to forged aluminum pistons and an ultra-strong crankcase, but Affalterbach\u2019s engineers don\u2019t appear finished with this powertrain.\n\u00a0\nDuring a recent presentation, Mercedes-AMG head of engine development Ralph Illenberger indicated to Car Sales there is more grunt on the agenda.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere will be more to come. There\u2019s always room for improvement. But 421 PS is really quite a high number, especially when it\u2019s also street-legal. That was the challenge. We\u2019ll see what the future will bring,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nIf AMG does boost horsepower and torque figures from this engine, we could end up with some very exciting performance cars. And to think that a blue-blood supercar of the early 2000s, like, theFFerrari 360 Modena, had \u201conly\u201d 395 horses at its disposal (and less torque) \u2013 and, from what we recall, was ferociously fast.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

        "comment": "\n\t\t\t\nHow Mercedes-AMG made the most powerful turbo four-cylinder engine in the world\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nMercedes-AMG recently unveiled the all-new M139 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. It\u2019s a complete redesign of the previous-gen M133 four-cylinder motor in the outgoing Mercedes-AMG A45, CLA45, and GLA45. And, with up to 415 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque available, the M139 earns the title of the most powerful four-cylinder engine in the world.\n\u00a0\nThe old M133 is by no means lacking in power. Mercedes tuned it for 208 horsepower in the current GLA 250, and 375 horsepower in the GLA 45. Time, tide, and an appetite for horsepower waits for nobody, however, and combined with toughening emissions requirements and the desire for the smallest and lightest package, the power-hungry boffins at Mercedes-AMG went to work and burned the midnight oil to create the new M139.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThe result is 382 horsepower in its standard form, which is a reasonable jump from the 375 horsepower output of the old motor. In its most potent \u2018S\u2019 form, however, the M139 churns out 415 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque.\n\u00a0\nHowever this new motor isn\u2019t just about a hike in power figures. The aim was to alter the torque delivery, too, with the screaming action of an F1 motor as AMG\u2019s inspiration. If there\u2019s one thing missing in the old M133, after all, it\u2019s the lack of torque at higher engine speeds. The previous engine had a tendency to dump its power at low engine speeds like a diesel motor, but then flatline as the engine reaches the upper limits of the rev range. In contrast, the M139 aims for a rush of acceleration regardless of the engine speed.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nMercedes says the new 2.0-liter four-cylinder produces peak torque at 5,200 rpm. However, it also generates higher amounts of torque between 1,000-2,000 rpm compared to the old engine. The most vigorous push comes as early as 3,000 rpm, the automaker promises, with the M139 shaping up to provide instant shove without the need to bury the gas pedal. And, since the engine torque is better distributed, you also get a driving feel more similar to that of a naturally-aspirated, big displacement motor.\n\u00a0\nAchieving all that required tossing out the old blueprints and coming up with new plans. The M139 engine is entirely new, only carrying over a handful of nuts and bolts from its predecessor. Mercedes-AMG developed a lighter \u2013 yet stronger \u2013 cylinder block, that withstands 160 bar (2,320 psi) of combustion pressure.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nMercedes says this new alloy block is as strong and rigid as the cylinder block in a modern diesel motor. It\u2019s also designed to mimic the strengthening characteristics of a diesel engine block with a closed-deck design, part-closed crankcase, and strengthening skirts in the cylinder housing.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen there are larger valve seats and exhaust valves, a new water jacket, and segregated coolant plumbing for the cylinder head and block. The engine also benefits from electric water pumps that operate independently to the engine: they mean the motor can continue to cool down the engine block, cylinder head, and turbocharger even after turning off the engine. Additionally, Mercedes-AMG bolted on a new 16-valve cylinder head with Camtronic variable inlet and exhaust valves. This system combines two camshaft profiles to deliver enhanced throttle response and better fuel economy.\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nArguably the most interesting aspect of the M139 is the dual fuel injectors found in each cylinder. In normal driving, the fuel is delivered by the single piezo-injector on top of the motor. At higher engine speeds or under hard acceleration, though, a second fuel injector in the inlet manifold tract kicks in. It supplies more fuel to sustain the boost delivery inside the combustion chamber.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s also a new and larger turbocharger residing between the engine and the front bulkhead. This unusual location necessitates better cooling techniques to prevent the blower from overheating under sustained high-rpm operation. This is achievable thanks to the new coolant plumbing, but most of it has something to do with the new engine cover that directs cooling air to the turbocharger. Mercedes says the 415-horsepower \u2018S\u2019 version of the M139 also utilizes cooling air from the HVAC system when needed. The turbocharger itself is a low-friction roller bearing design with an electronically-controlled wastegate.\n\u00a0\nThe most powerful four-cylinder engine in the world is no mass-produced motor. Each engine is still built by hand in accordance with AMG\u2019s tradition of the \u2018one man, one engine\u2019 method. However, Mercedes established a more streamlined approach in engine building using the latest in modern technology. Each person on the line makes use of special power tools that electronically record the torque applied to each fixture and the assembly sequence. Mercedes claims this new approach allows the AMG manufacturing facility to churn out 140 engines each day in two alternating shifts. It also reduces production time by 20- to 25-percent.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Thanks to new European regulations, exhaust notes are getting quieter, and not even AMG\u2019s burly performance cars, nor its competitors, can avoid them. And that involves AMG cars outside Europe, too.\n\u00a0\n\nIn an interview with Motoring, Bastian Bogenschutz, Mercedes-AMG\u2019s head of product planning for compact cars, told the publication all markets are affected by Europe\u2019s legislative changes. It\u2019s too expensive to design specific exhausts for each individual market. That includes the U.S., which means AMG\u2019s other means of auditory delivery will have to suffice. The regulations are also getting more stringent about every two years, which further complicates the problem.\n\u00a0\nTwo of the first vehicles these new regulations are quieting is the 2020 Mercedes-AMG A 45 S and 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S, which also happen to pack what Mercedes calls the world\u2019s most powerful four-cylinder engine. European regulators don\u2019t want you to hear it. However, thanks to technology, and the dissatisfaction of some, AMG is countering the new regulations by enhancing the in-cabin exhaust note. The company added the AMG pure performance sound, which takes the real exhaust sound and moves it inside.\n\u00a0\nIn-car audio systems mimicking exhaust and engine noises aren\u2019t new, as are other creative ways to enhance the driving experience. And it\u2019s not an ideal solution either, but it\u2019s better than nothing. While European regulations will quiet future AMG vehicles, the robust aftermarket scene should provide plenty of solutions to rectify the quietness. Sound is a visceral part of the driving experience, and nothing beats a series of loud pops, burbles, and wails from the a stellar exhaust system. But times are changing, which means there are new regulations automakers have to follow.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Thanks to new European regulations, exhaust notes are getting quieter, and not even AMG\u2019s burly performance cars, nor its competitors, can avoid them. And that involves AMG cars outside Europe, too.\n\u00a0\n\nIn an interview with Motoring, Bastian Bogenschutz, Mercedes-AMG\u2019s head of product planning for compact cars, told the publication all markets are affected by Europe\u2019s legislative changes. It\u2019s too expensive to design specific exhausts for each individual market. That includes the U.S., which means AMG\u2019s other means of auditory delivery will have to suffice. The regulations are also getting more stringent about every two years, which further complicates the problem.\n\u00a0\nTwo of the first vehicles these new regulations are quieting is the 2020 Mercedes-AMG A 45 S and 2020 Mercedes-AMG CLA 45 S, which also happen to pack what Mercedes calls the world\u2019s most powerful four-cylinder engine. European regulators don\u2019t want you to hear it. However, thanks to technology, and the dissatisfaction of some, AMG is countering the new regulations by enhancing the in-cabin exhaust note. The company added the AMG pure performance sound, which takes the real exhaust sound and moves it inside.\n\u00a0\nIn-car audio systems mimicking exhaust and engine noises aren\u2019t new, as are other creative ways to enhance the driving experience. And it\u2019s not an ideal solution either, but it\u2019s better than nothing. While European regulations will quiet future AMG vehicles, the robust aftermarket scene should provide plenty of solutions to rectify the quietness. Sound is a visceral part of the driving experience, and nothing beats a series of loud pops, burbles, and wails from the a stellar exhaust system. But times are changing, which means there are new regulations automakers have to follow.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\ninterestingly, when you start up the new A45s with the +plus paddle towards u, the roar is louder.\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

Well, according to\u00a0the AMG head honcho, Tobias Moers, there\u2019s much more to it than that.\n\n\n\n\tDuring the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show, where the two 45 S models were on deck, Moers said: \u201cThe reason [why it makes so much power] is that we\u2019re going to use it for further applications, which are not necessarily east-west applications.\u201d In plain English, he confirmed that it can be mounted longitudinally as well, as opposed to the transverse application in the A45 and CLA 45, thus opening the door to numerous possibilities.\n\n\n\n\tNonetheless, it probably won\u2019t give birth to a C45 or an E45, but could replace the ICE units of the 43 and 53 models, albeit with the help of electrification. Mercedes-AMG has already announced it will to go down this road, and adding an electric motor will make the already powerful engine even crazier.\n\n\n\n\tCould it, as some suggest, eventually take over even the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 found in modern AMG 63s, producing around 600 horsepower? Sure, downsizing and electrification are all the rage in the industry right now, though that seems like a very long stretch, especially for high-end AMGs where, we presume, four-bangers won\u2019t sit very well with customers right now.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
