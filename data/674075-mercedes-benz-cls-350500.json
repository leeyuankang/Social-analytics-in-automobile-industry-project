There's this touch of class to this vehicle that makes it so different. even when compared to the current W220 platform, i still think the new CLS is a much better choice although it's thought to be of a lower range among the 2. It just drags the car away from the \"Tow Kay\" image of Benz. Think it would attract young executive (make that RICH young executives) who have been favouring BMW over Mercedes Benz.\n\u00a0\nAll in all, that's a car i would want to step out of, preferably infront of a crowd.lol  \n\u00a0\n(except the Maclaren SLR.   )\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"

AMG boss Tobias Moers confirmed in LA\u00a0that\u00a0\"The 53 nomenclature will feature on AMG models which only use petrol-electric hybrid powertrains\", with the\u00a0CLS 53 being the first when it arrivces at the Detroit motor show in January. He said the car will have 429bhp.\nAutocar understands that this electrified\u00a0model will become the new range-topper, spelling the end of the\u00a0V8-engined\u00a0Mercedes-AMG CLS 63, which makes way for the AMG GT\u00a0four-door (read on for more).\nWhat we already know\nPrior to the leak, Autocar revealed that the new CLS will grow\u00a0beyond the 4940mm length, 1880mm width and 1420mm height of the outgoing second-generation CLS, which has been on sale since 2010.\n\nCLS Project Leader Michael Kelz has recently divulged to Autocar during a prototype CLS drive that the third-generation model has a drag coefficient of 0.27. This is somewhat short of the 0.23 of the latest E-Class, though it is said to be achieved with near-to-zero lift without the necessity to equip the new model with an active spoiler like that used by Audi on its new second-generation A7.\n\"The big challenge is the CLS's sloping rear end, which remains a key styling characteristic. It hinders efforts to create downforce. To provide a suitable balance between stability and drag, we\u2019ve incorporated some special aerodynamic solutions within the car's undertray,\u201d he said.\nIn the interests of weight saving, the outer body is made predominantly from aluminium, including the bonnet, wheel arches\u00a0and boot lid. As with the E-Class, though, the four doors are all fashioned from steel.\nMercedes-Benz claims the frameless design of the doors, a design element brought over from the previous two generations of the CLS, brings advantages in refinement, with the rubber sealing around the top of the windows said to offer more aerodynamic properties than that of framed doors.\n\u201cThey\u2019re quieter at speed than the doors we use on the E-Class,\u201d said Kelz. \u201cThe difference is not great, but our tests have shown there is less buffeting with the frameless design, especially at motorway speeds.\u201d\nMercedes-Benz CLS interior\n\nThe CLS is no longer as uniquely styled nor quite as eye-catching as those found in previous incarnations of the German saloon, which featured their own uniquely styled fascia.\u00a0\nIn a bid to provide the new model with additional economies of scale with other Mercedes-Benz models in a bid to lower development, component sourcing and production costs, it also receives a lightly reworked version of the latest E-Class\u2019s dashboard, complete with a so-called Widescreen Cockpit with twin 12.3in screens for the instruments and infotainment system.\nThere\u2019s also a new multifunction steering wheel borrowed from the recently facelifted S-Class. The new turbine air vents from the recently introduced E-Class Coup\u00e9 are also adopted, but, in a first for the CLS, they glow either blue or red depending on the temperature at which the air conditioning is set.\nKelz said: \u201cWe have provided it with all the technical features and options already offered on the latest E-Class and S-Class models. This is important in markets such as China, where buyers place a big emphasis on luxury,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the CLS is also considered a more sporting alternative to both of them in other markets. In Europe, it\u2019s seen as a driver\u2019s car, and this has played a key role in its development.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nIn the rear, there\u2019s now a dedicated centre seat position between two more heavily sculptured positions in a three-across bench. \u201cWe\u2019ve received feedback from earlier CLS buyers requesting a fifth seat. Its inclusion is part of our efforts to provide the new model with greater everyday practicality,\u201d says Kelz.\nThe new CLS also benefits from the adoption of a 61mm-longer wheelbase, at 4988mm, with the upshot that there are now larger rear door apertures and, in combination with a corresponding increase in width, more accommodation in the back. Boot space has also increased over the second-generation CLS, Kelz confirmed.\nMercedes-Benz CLS powertrains\n\nWhen the new CLS hits showrooms next year, it will offer a limited range of four\u00a0and six-cylinder petrol and diesel engines \u2013 all in combination with Mercedes-Benz\u2019s 9G-Tronic\u00a0nine-speed automatic gearbox as standard. Insiders told Autocar that buyers\u00a0will also get to choose between standard rear-wheel drive or optional 4Matic four-wheel drive on a number of models.\nThe petrol units feature Mercedes-Benz\u2019s new EQ Power system, providing them with mild hybrid properties, relying on a newly developed 48V electric system.\nAs Autocar recently revealed,\u00a0the line-up will open with the CLS 350. This has the latest evolution of Mercedes-Benz\u2019s M264 petrol engine developing 295bhp and 295lb ft of torque. Next up is the CLS 450, which receives Mercedes-Benz\u2019s new M256 turbocharged and electronically supercharged 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder petrol engine with 362bhp and 369lb ft.\n\nTopping the petrol line-up, in the absence of plans for a successor to today\u2019s Mercedes-AMG CLS 63. will be the CLS 53. Set to be unveiled at the Detroit motor show in January 2018, this is planned to run an AMG-tuned version of the M256 turbocharged and electronic supercharged 2.9-litre six-cylinder petrol engine used in the CLS 450, with a claimed 429bhp and over 443lb ft.\nAlso planned from the outset of UK sales are a range of diesel models. These start with the CLS 300d, which runs Mercedes-Benz\u2019s existing OM654 designated turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine\u00a0with 228bhp and 332lb ft.\nA more powerful diesel, the new OM656 unit, will also be available. Recently unveiled in the facelifted S-Class, the turbocharged 2.9-litre in-line six-cylinder is set to kick out 282bhp and 443lb ft in the CLS 350d and 335bhp and 516lb ft in the CLS 400d.\nThe CLS will also feature a host of new technology. This includes some of the the semi-autonomous driving technology of the E-Class, including Speed Limit Pilot, which automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle in relation to posted speed limits, and Active Lane Change Assist, which is able to autonomously perform a lane change when the driver indicates.\nThe infotainment software and menus will all be related to those featured in the E-Class, with the image of the car's interior\u00a0showing that the dashboard will also feature a near-identical layout for its vents and centre console.\nThe Shooting Brake version of the CLS is\u00a0expected to be dropped due to low demand; just 750\u00a0CLS Shooting Brakes\u00a0were sold in the UK last year.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"
