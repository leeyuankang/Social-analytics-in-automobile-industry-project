6,Audi,Audi A4 Sedan,"$188,016 ","ReviewBought the 2019 facelift edition, whose interior is so much better than the 2018 one. Looks much more upscale as compared to last year. More chrome, and interior lighting that's classy rather than striking. 

The A4 beats everyone in its class when u compare its price. Significantly cheaper than the C class and 3 series, considering u get a 2.0T engine. Its fuel economy/power ratio hands down leaves the japanese counterparts in the dust too, like mazda, toyota. 

The drive is very calm and composed, for a 2.0 turbocharged engine, cruising at 1200RPM constantly: explains the fuel efficiency. Sports mode is very toned down, only keeping RPM at 2000, which is very weird andl doesn't maximise the car's potential. Paddle shifters are a must to use, if you want to maximise the car's power. No worries though, as it can overtake any car in traffic in a breeze, without even hitting 3000rpm, with its 320NM powerband from 1200rpm to 4000rpm. 

The A4 is very under-provided for, for an Audi. Horrific 16 inch rims, no memory seat for a family sedan, virtual cockpit is not stock. The audi drive select is completely fake, comfort mode is redundant, no adaptive dampers or air suspensions means they can't really improve ride comfort. Dynamic mode makes the steering artificially heavy, instead of responsive with high feedback.",josephannnn,"bought 2019 facelift edition, whose interior much better 2018 one. looks much upscale compared last year. chrome, interior lighting that's classy rather striking. a4 beats everyone class u compare price. significantly cheaper c class 3 series, considering u get 2.0t engine. fuel economy/power ratio hands leaves japanese counterparts dust too, like mazda, toyota. drive calm composed, 2.0 turbocharged engine, cruising 1200rpm constantly: explains fuel efficiency. sports mode toned down, keeping rpm 2000, weird andl maximise car's potential. paddle shifters must use, want maximise car's power. worries though, overtake car traffic breeze, without even hitting 3000rpm, 320nm powerband 1200rpm 4000rpm. a4 under-provided for, audi. horrific 16 inch rims, memory seat family sedan, virtual cockpit stock. audi drive select completely fake, comfort mode redundant, adaptive dampers air suspensions means can't really improve ride comfort. dynamic mode makes steering artificially heavy, instead responsive high feedback."
7,Audi,Audi A3 Sedan,"$136,460 ","ReviewDecided on the A3 as my first car due to its price point. Got it at 110K at suntec roadshow in July. Have clocked 1000KM and liking it so far, especially the fuel consumption. I really liked the colour combination of dark blue exterior with dark brown leather seats. I was given the apple carplay option but didnt want it as i honestly don't think its that useful. Ive tried it on other Jap car and sometimes it doesnt even charge the phone. I can just connect to the audio using bluetooth which is good enough for me.",Bernardongg,"decided a3 first car due price point. got 110k suntec roadshow july. clocked 1000km liking far, especially fuel consumption. really liked colour combination dark blue exterior dark brown leather seats. given apple carplay option didnt want honestly think useful. ive tried jap car sometimes doesnt even charge phone. connect audio using bluetooth good enough me."
8,Audi,Audi Q2,"$140,776 ","ReviewBought my white Audi Q2 1.4 turbo TFSI engine last month and it appeared to be one of the best decisions I've made. Traded in my 5 year old BMW 5 series for this and to be very honest, I was initially concerned with the space. I owned a Mini Cooper and 3 series before this. The Q2 of course cannot be compared to the cabin space of a 5 series. But I wanted something fun and zippy to drive. Something with power that looks great on the road and at the same time fun to drive without being a fuel guzzler. Reviewing this from my experience, I'd say the Q2 has the best of both worlds of both the trendiness of the Mini Cooper and the moderness and style of an Audi. It's simply the most fun car I've driven! Superb handling on the roads. Interior cabin is kept simple so if you're looking for something techy and elaborate then you might consider the highest end model. Fuel economy is one to beat. This week I drove 179km on just one bar (out of 8 bars) of petrol. Full tank about $90. 

Love the exterior daytime headlights as well as the interior mood lighting that allows you to play with lights (just like my old mini). Not to mention the fantastic sound system made by B&O. Fits 4 comfortably. 5 would be a squeeze. Good enough for me if you're mostly a solo driver like me. 

All in all, if you're looking for a stylish yet fun car from a renowned brand that ticks all the right boxes and will not burn a huge hole in your pocket, the Q2 is the one for you.",DariusLim_195334,"bought white audi q2 1.4 turbo tfsi engine last month appeared one best decisions i've made. traded 5 year old bmw 5 series honest, initially concerned space. owned mini cooper 3 series this. q2 course cannot compared cabin space 5 series. wanted something fun zippy drive. something power looks great road time fun drive without fuel guzzler. reviewing experience, i'd say q2 best worlds trendiness mini cooper moderness style audi. simply fun car i've driven! superb handling roads. interior cabin kept simple looking something techy elaborate might consider highest end model. fuel economy one beat. week drove 179km one bar (out 8 bars) petrol. full tank $90. love exterior daytime headlights well interior mood lighting allows play lights (just like old mini). mention fantastic sound system made b&o. fits 4 comfortably. 5 would squeeze. good enough mostly solo driver like me. all, looking stylish yet fun car renowned brand ticks right boxes burn huge hole pocket, q2 one you."
9,Audi,Audi A5 Sportback,"$204,900 ","ReviewReally like this stylish car as its sportback profile sets it apart from the rest of the SUVs/MPVs/sedans

During the test drive, felt that the engine and gearbox was really smooth and acceleration from stop is a breeze.  The interior is the typical high quality Audi fare (ie. A4 and above) and makes me feel special in the driver seat

Cabin is also very well insulated as I hardly hear any noise on the move. 

Car is practical too as the boot opens up with the rear glass which gives easy access.",Lotr,"ally like stylish car sportback profile sets apart rest suvs/mpvs/sedansduring test drive, felt engine gearbox really smooth acceleration stop breeze. interior typical high quality audi fare (ie. a4 above) makes feel special driver seatcabin also well insulated hardly hear noise move. car practical boot opens rear glass gives easy access."
11,Audi,Audi A6 Sedan Mild Hybrid,"$242,500 ","ReviewTest driven this new A6 last weekend. Must say it's Astonishing indeed. 

First looks is the impressive lights at the front and rear as well as the curves of its new design body, though you may have to look carefully to notice the curves. 

Inside is a brand new interior compared to the previous generation where no more budge out ugly screens, making it look odd looking. Now is all totally flushed in console, making it a luxury feel in it. Great mind thoughts finally. 

The gadgets are great to have in all like the virtual 360 degree revolving camera, enhanced virtual cockpit, full touch screen console with handwriting recognition capability, and much more to your astonishment. 

A pity that no variant comes with panaromic sunroof where you need to pay as option. 

The drive is great as it comes with more power, less drag, 7 speed wet clutch gearbox (not the problematic dry clutch), more horses too. 

Gearshifts are a Breeze and power delivery is certainly better than its predecessor, and in stoppages is not jerked at. Is a gradual stop with almost to no feel of it. Has heads up display too.

Passenger at the back does experience a comfort feel as during my test drive, an Uncle followed too and too comfortable drive, even at dynamic mode, he almost fell asleep.

Only thing didn't ask if it comes with any park assist or so to try on. 

Overall, it's an improved A6 if you see it and for its drive, gadgets and best of all, its new refined interior with all nicely flushed in, thus giving it a high end luxury feeling.

It's kinda worth considering if you have a deep pocket of $240k (as of 9 September 2019).",Mervynwm,"test driven new a6 last weekend. must say astonishing indeed. first looks impressive lights front rear well curves new design body, though may look carefully notice curves. inside brand new interior compared previous generation budge ugly screens, making look odd looking. totally flushed console, making luxury feel it. great mind thoughts finally. gadgets great like virtual 360 degree revolving camera, enhanced virtual cockpit, full touch screen console handwriting recognition capability, much astonishment. pity variant comes panaromic sunroof need pay option. drive great comes power, less drag, 7 speed wet clutch gearbox (not problematic dry clutch), horses too. gearshifts breeze power delivery certainly better predecessor, stoppages jerked at. gradual stop almost feel it. heads display too.passenger back experience comfort feel test drive, uncle followed comfortable drive, even dynamic mode, almost fell asleep.only thing ask comes park assist try on. overall, improved a6 see drive, gadgets best all, new refined interior nicely flushed in, thus giving high end luxury feeling.it's kinda worth considering deep pocket $240k (as 9 september 2019)."
13,Audi,Audi A3 Sportback,"$134,250 ","ReviewGot my new car 26 December 2014 from Premium Auto. It's been three months, so far here are my findings;

1. Having driven VW/Skoda cars before, in comparison, the Audi feels much better put together, quality materials, insulation, road presence and confidence it gives.
2. Noise insulation is superb except for the tyre noise caused by the sports derivative tyres that came with the car. Perhaps it should be shod with Bridgestone Turanza series instead?
3. After doing 2500km, the 1.4 TFSI starts to feel more lively. When new from the showroom, it was a bit lazy from take off but when at speed, especially if the rpm is from 1500, the take off for overtaking is noticeable.
4. Noticed a lag below 1200 rpm or from stand still, there was a slight hesitation when you floor the pedal when you move off. In comparison to my previous Skoda Octavia 1.4 TFSI, the difference is stark (although I had a remap done which gave it 150 bhp and about 250nm of torque from 1750rpm). That skoda, you can feel the G-force pressing against you. In the A3, hardly noticeable. 
5. Fuel consumption is somewhat better than the Octavia. 12.5km/l mixed. Up to 18/19km/l on the highway, quite close to the published 20km/l.
6. Features wise, it has all the bells and whistles that one can hope for, although a navigation system would have been welcomed, it's not very expansive nowadays. I'm not really into installing after market.
7. Advice for those who wants to do a remap, all the ports have been sealed and breaking those seals would void warranty. I'd wait for the car to pass the warranty period before considering it.
8. Space wise, it a lot more spacious now with the MQB platform and longer wheelbase compared to my MK 5 Octavia. 

All in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend anyone who is considering it.",vbchia,"got new car 26 december 2014 premium auto. three months, far findings;1. driven vw/skoda cars before, comparison, audi feels much better put together, quality materials, insulation, road presence confidence gives.2. noise insulation superb except tyre noise caused sports derivative tyres came car. perhaps shod bridgestone turanza series instead?3. 2500km, 1.4 tfsi starts feel lively. new showroom, bit lazy take speed, especially rpm 1500, take overtaking noticeable.4. noticed lag 1200 rpm stand still, slight hesitation floor pedal move off. comparison previous skoda octavia 1.4 tfsi, difference stark (although remap done gave 150 bhp 250nm torque 1750rpm). skoda, feel g-force pressing you. a3, hardly noticeable. 5. fuel consumption somewhat better octavia. 12.5km/l mixed. 18/19km/l highway, quite close published 20km/l.6. features wise, bells whistles one hope for, although navigation system would welcomed, expansive nowadays. i'm really installing market.7. advice wants remap, ports sealed breaking seals would void warranty. i'd wait car pass warranty period considering it.8. space wise, lot spacious mqb platform longer wheelbase compared mk 5 octavia. i'm happy purchase would recommend anyone considering it."

17,Audi,Audi Q7,"$307,800 ","ReviewThe Audi Q7 is arguably the best 7 seater premium SUV in the market now. It is comfortable and looks really good. Handling and engine performance are good too. While the car is rather large, it rides and drives like a normal car with good acceleration in Sports Mode.

Price is slightly high too but with Premium Automobile's warranty support, the peace of mind could be worth it.",Nivlek96,"audi q7 arguably best 7 seater premium suv market now. comfortable looks really good. handling engine performance good too. car rather large, rides drives like normal car good acceleration sports mode. reliability could one audi's weaker aspects several friends switching audi mercedes. price slightly high premium automobile's warranty support, peace mind could worth it."
