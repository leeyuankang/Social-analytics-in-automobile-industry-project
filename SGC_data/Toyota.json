During my daily commute from the west to east, the car provide linear power across the range and it has sufficient power to do overtake on the highway. \n\nDoing my higher speed run in the North country, it is stable at 150km/h - 160km/h, it does give the confidence when travelling at that speed and the engine does not show sign of strain at that speed. \n\nThe rear passenger space was one of the best among it class. It does not have a hump across the middle seat that most cars have which allow passenger to easily seat in the middle. Even with 2 child seat in the rear seat, it was still able to fit in and average size adult for short commute. \n\nThe air con was also one of the best in class, even without the rear aircon vent. It was able to cool down the car quickly and the airflow was strong enough to blow the air into the back seat, stratifying my kids request. On a normal day, i only turn on 1 bar of airflow. \n\nMy servicing experience with Toyota has been positive. Was able to arrange last min appointment and the operator will try their best to accommodate my request even with a few days notice.  They also provide car cleaning service after the service, which was a plus but at time the car was still having some stain leftover by the technical crew. \n\nHowever for the fuel consumption, it is on the higher side. At 60% Highway i was only able to clock 10-11km/l for a 1.6L car whereas on paper it state 16km combine. I think this is quite far from my expectation. \n\noverall the experience of owning Altis was positive and the made and finish material are on the higher side as compared to the competitor. For point A to B car, from my opinion this is 1 of the best car to own with high rating for their reliability.",

So was hunting for a SUV or MPV for a change and also to give more space for my children who are growing. \n\nI personally prefer Mercedes GLC 250 which is more stylish but I do not wish to spend more than $200k for a car again. Also, although conti cars are better in terms of performance but they are so unreliable after driving 2 different German brands. So back to basic, Japanese car (although I did consider Korean)\n\nWas contemplating between Subaru Forester and Toyota Harrier (although I test drove Honda Odyssey but wasn't impressed by its price $170k+ and its features). Also, consider Skoda Kodiaq but the mark up for profit was about 34% And unsure about its resale value  in the future. Also tried Kia Sorrento but it was powered by 2.2l diesel. I still could not get used to the rattle sound of diesel engine although it is pleasant and smooth during my test drive. Chose Harrier over Forrester because Turbo version for Forrester was no longer available and the mark up was something over 30% (info. From Sgcarmart) which I thought was high. Since Agent is now carrying this model and with Turbo and having drove my friend's P.I. Harrier for a week, I thought it was decent for me to consider it. Also, mark up over cost at the time of buying (Apr 18) was 13% Which I believe is more reasonable compared with other brands.\n\nSo having drove for about 9 months, I would say it is a decent ride.",

As such, I decided to test drive the car and fell in love immediately.\n\nMight be a personal thing, but I preferred the Harrier looks over Mazda CX5 and even Mercedes GLC as it looks sleeker and less cumbersome.\n\nThe Turbo (227bhp) is powerful enough to let you overtake and accelerate with ease, and you won't even hear the engine roar as you speed past the other vehicles on the road. Mind you, I am a family man and appreciate the silence and ease of acceleration while my kids play and rest in the back seat. If you are looking for a car with stronger acceleration and more bite, this might not be the car for you.\n\nBased on a normal driving pattern, I am usually able to hit 100km/hr with revs at approx 1500 to 1800. This usually takes me about 10 secs from standstill (Normal mode, I haven't tried Sports mode yet).\n\nEco mode, on the other hand, is meant to save fuel and you can feel the significant lag in pick up speed. I had only used this mode once when I was in no real hurry to get to my destination. Otherwise, 99% Of the time, Normal mode will suffice.\n\nSteering is light as compared to my previous \"Continental\" Ride (Cruze) but in a way, I am starting to appreciate being able to turn the wheel with ease (sometimes with one hand).\n\nThere are more and more Harriers on the roads and there is a good reason why.

And for some people, well, that may not be a bad thing. Here's why:\n\nLet's say you're young, you don't want an \"Uncle/auntie\" Car so in terms of style, you're looking for something sporty. But to be really practical, you're not going to be able to take more than 1 friend to go to Thompson so you can't get the 2 door convertible. So you compromise: You accept that it's going to be a relatively bigger crossover/suv, but you also get a sleek sporty look.\n\nOkay so you also say you want something that has good speed/power. The C-HR Hybrid? Well, it's FINE. It's average. You DO get to seamlessly merge on highways and overtake lanes without anxiety wondering if you're going to make it on time, but you ALSO have to deal with the fact that suddenly the whisper quiet hybrid engine has to work a bit (it's not untolerable) and suddenly there's some noise coming in.\n\nLastly a few notes that I noted are different from my experience and what others are saying about this car.\n1) You CAN actually change the language of the dashboard to English, or at least the PI I got it from sold models that could.\n2) Rainsensing wipers is available on some models of the C-HR or at least on the one I got.\n3) Blindspot.

        "review": "ReviewAfter driving it for 2 months, I would say that the Harrier is excellent. There is ample power for pick up even though the engine is only 2.0L, and the ECO mode saves lots of fuel when I am on the expressway. The exterior is stylish and sleek, without being too sharp like the Lexus NX. The interior is beautifully crafted with side doors and dashboard wrapped in leather, seats are soft with stylish fabric and comfortable. The steering is also very easy to manoeuvre. The height is just nice, giving a clear view of the road yet not being too high for elderly to get in. The tail light is very beautiful and looks like Audi's. The Harrier is definitely value for money.\nThe Elegance is good enough for me as I do not need power tailgate and Lane Departure Assist (Premium).",

The eco mode saves on fuel while switching to power mode packs in a punch to the speed! Highly recommend to anyone who is thinking of buying a SUV.\n\nWas very cautious while selecting the PI. Finally decided on ABWIN, very happy to be served by Alan who is excellent in his service, integrity and follow up in satisfying the customer's expectations. Car was delivered on the date as promised.",
