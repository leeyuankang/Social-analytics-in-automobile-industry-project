        "review": "ReviewBought the 2019 facelift edition, whose interior is so much better than the 2018 one. Looks much more upscale as compared to last year. More chrome, and interior lighting that's classy rather than striking. \n\nThe A4 beats everyone in its class when u compare its price. Significantly cheaper than the C class and 3 series, considering u get a 2.0T engine. Its fuel economy/power ratio hands down leaves the japanese counterparts in the dust too, like mazda, toyota. \n\nThe drive is very calm and composed, for a 2.0 turbocharged engine, cruising at 1200RPM constantly: explains the fuel efficiency. Sports mode is very toned down, only keeping RPM at 2000, which is very weird andl doesn't maximise the car's potential. Paddle shifters are a must to use, if you want to maximise the car's power. No worries though, as it can overtake any car in traffic in a breeze, without even hitting 3000rpm, with its 320NM powerband from 1200rpm to 4000rpm. \n\nThe A4 is very under-provided for, for an Audi. Horrific 16 inch rims, no memory seat for a family sedan, virtual cockpit is not stock. The audi drive select is completely fake, comfort mode is redundant, no adaptive dampers or air suspensions means they can't really improve ride comfort. Dynamic mode makes the steering artificially heavy, instead of responsive with high feedback.",

In other words, plain vanilla.\n\nThe exterior styling of the car, in my opinion, is the most handsome when compared to the BMW 1 series of the MB A-class. It has the kind of executive look to it.\n\nThe interior design is simple but it definitely doesn't look cheap! Audi has definitely found the balance by designing the cabin in such a way that it has to be functional but without being too over the top (read: Saab). Like the old 'iPod', the knob right behind the gear lever makes navigating on the media console a breeze.\n\nThe Audi Drive Select function looks like a cool feature to be had. It makes the driver feel like in control of your vehicle as if you were in a true-blue sports car. However, after trying out all the different modes from Auto to Dynamic, I am convinced that this feature is nothing more than just a pun to make the car stands out from their competitors. Either that or my senses refuse to react to the competency of a 1.0 turbocharged car. Nevertheless, despite the very obvious turbo-lag at stop, the engine has enough oomph to overtake at cruising speed and more than enough to win (most) short sprint to your next traffic light.\n\nPaying a premium price for this car, you would expect a lot from it. However, the definition of 'a lot' can be conflicting to different people. And this is quite true for Audi. You get a lot of the hard product... Like the badge 0000, the driving dynamics, German engineering, etc. The soft product like the Sat Nav, Apple Car Play, USB PORTS (YES! USB PORTS ARE NON-EXISTENT), Solar Film, Car Mats, In-car recording camera, reverse camera, servicing package, the list goes on.... Are EXCLUSIVE AND OPTIONAL.

Traded in my 5 year old BMW 5 series for this and to be very honest, I was initially concerned with the space. I owned a Mini Cooper and 3 series before this. The Q2 of course cannot be compared to the cabin space of a 5 series. But I wanted something fun and zippy to drive. Something with power that looks great on the road and at the same time fun to drive without being a fuel guzzler. Reviewing this from my experience, I'd say the Q2 has the best of both worlds of both the trendiness of the Mini Cooper and the moderness and style of an Audi. It's simply the most fun car I've driven! Superb handling on the roads. Interior cabin is kept simple so if you're looking for something techy and elaborate then you might consider the highest end model. Fuel economy is one to beat. This week I drove 179km on just one bar (out of 8 bars) of petrol. Full tank about $90. \n\nLove the exterior daytime headlights as well as the interior mood lighting that allows you to play with lights (just like my old mini). Not to mention the fantastic sound system made by B&O. Fits 4 comfortably. 5 would be a squeeze. Good enough for me if you're mostly a solo driver like me. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a stylish yet fun car from a renowned brand that ticks all the right boxes and will not burn a huge hole in your pocket, the Q2 is the one for you.",

Now is all totally flushed in console, making it a luxury feel in it. Great mind thoughts finally. \n\nThe gadgets are great to have in all like the virtual 360 degree revolving camera, enhanced virtual cockpit, full touch screen console with handwriting recognition capability, and much more to your astonishment. \n\nA pity that no variant comes with panaromic sunroof where you need to pay as option. \n\nThe drive is great as it comes with more power, less drag, 7 speed wet clutch gearbox (not the problematic dry clutch), more horses too. \n\nGearshifts are a Breeze and power delivery is certainly better than its predecessor, and in stoppages is not jerked at. Is a gradual stop with almost to no feel of it. Has heads up display too.\n\nPassenger at the back does experience a comfort feel as during my test drive, an Uncle followed too and too comfortable drive, even at dynamic mode, he almost fell asleep.\n\nOnly thing didn't ask if it comes with any park assist or so to try on. \n\nOverall, it's an improved A6 if you see it and for its drive, gadgets and best of all, its new refined interior with all nicely flushed in, thus giving it a high end luxury feeling.\n\nIt's kinda worth considering if you have a deep pocket of $240k (as of 9 September 2019).",

Having driven VW/Skoda cars before, in comparison, the Audi feels much better put together, quality materials, insulation, road presence and confidence it gives.\n2. Noise insulation is superb except for the tyre noise caused by the sports derivative tyres that came with the car. Perhaps it should be shod with Bridgestone Turanza series instead?\n3. After doing 2500km, the 1.4 TFSI starts to feel more lively. When new from the showroom, it was a bit lazy from take off but when at speed, especially if the rpm is from 1500, the take off for overtaking is noticeable.\n4. Noticed a lag below 1200 rpm or from stand still, there was a slight hesitation when you floor the pedal when you move off. In comparison to my previous Skoda Octavia 1.4 TFSI, the difference is stark (although I had a remap done which gave it 150 bhp and about 250nm of torque from 1750rpm). That skoda, you can feel the G-force pressing against you. In the A3, hardly noticeable. \n5. Fuel consumption is somewhat better than the Octavia. 12.5km/l mixed. Up to 18/19km/l on the highway, quite close to the published 20km/l.\n6. Features wise, it has all the bells and whistles that one can hope for, although a navigation system would have been welcomed, it's not very expansive nowadays. I'm not really into installing after market.\n7. Advice for those who wants to do a remap, all the ports have been sealed and breaking those seals would void warranty. I'd wait for the car to pass the warranty period before considering it.\n8. Space wise, it a lot more spacious now with the MQB platform and longer wheelbase compared to my MK 5 Octavia. \n\nAll in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend anyone who is considering it.",

While the car is rather large, it rides and drives like a normal car with good acceleration in Sports Mode. Reliability could be one of Audi's weaker aspects with several friends switching from Audi to Mercedes.
