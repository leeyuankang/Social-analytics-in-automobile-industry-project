        "review": "ReviewDriven the IS200t Exec for about a year at the time of writing. It's a great car to drive in. Coming from a Ford Mondeo, the IS200t is a huge step up in comfort and driving experience. \n\nThe interior is of high quality and it's big enough for my family even though the space is less than what we were used to. \n\nReliability has to be proven after a few years but so far so good. Additionally, Lexus is known to be reliable so all it's all good. \n\nStyling wise, it's really striking. Personally, it looks great to me but I have seen on forums that some do not like it; It's very subjective. \n\nPrice wise, do not be fooled by the listed price. Borneo Motors usually gives pretty good discounts, so don't be too put off by the price. Also, spec for spec with other marques, the IS actually has a price advantage. And because the OMV is rather high, the annual depreciation is competitively priced in this segment\n\nEngine performance is objectively really smooth during normal operations. During hard acceleration from standstill there is abit of turbo lag. But once the turbo lag is over, there is a strong sense of acceleration of getting pinned to your seats (especially when SPORT mode is on). The engine is really potent for Singapore roads.\n\nBeing more light-footed, I averaged about 12km/l. Do note that I'm almost on ECO mode with Auto Start/Stop off whenever I drive. 60% Highway 40% City.\n\nThe service rendered at Borneo Motors during service is second to none. You are treated really well with good facilities. You get a meal every time you service and the service representative is professional in his dealings. Usually, I would dread going for servicing but with Lexus' Borneo Motors, I actually found myself looking forward to it.",

This has made it on par or even bigger than its German competitors but keeping its sporty look.\n2) The sunroof that stretch from driver to rear passengers which you can still shielded it if the sun becomes too bright & hot.\n3) I am surprise at how quiet the cabin is even during cruising and overtaking, unlike the noisy turbocharged engine.\n4) The roomy interior let you feel posh and comfortable even for someone who is taller than 1.8M especially the rear leg room.\n5) Standard package include:\na) Keyless entry and auto start/stop\nb) Built in GPS and rear camera, safety sensor around the front and back of the car.\nc) Wireless phone charging in the car and multiple USB ports in front and back.\nd) The auto sensor to open car boot using your foot (useful features for family man when your hands are full of grocery)\ne) The safety features include auto detect when your car drift outside of your driving lanes, setting the safety distance with car in front, side mirror warning lights for vehicles in your blind spots just to name a few.\nf) Leather feels soft and there is even aircon blowing through both the front passenger seats (good features for hot weather SGP)\ng) The 2.5L engine is very smooth & powerful enough for SGP traffic. It is not punchy like turbocharged type. (If you like quick acceleration like BMW and sports engine, this is not your car)\n\nAdditional things thrown in by Borneo include front & back recording camera, 3M solar film, 5yrs warranty and 3yrs free service. Not forgetting my professional and friendly sales agent, Nicholas.",

A turbocharged 2.0-litre petrol , fitted with a six-speed automatic gearbox rather than the CVT of the hybrid , is a pricey , sports-oriented range-topper to this distinctive looking four-wheeled drive SUV.\n\nThe large signature Lexus spindle grill design that gives the car an aggressive road presence.\n\nIt comes with a well built interior that is nicely outfitted. The Dual-Zone climate control settings allow the driver and the front passenger to adjust their preferred temperatures. A good added feature is the touch-sensitive dome lights and map light switches , which activate with a gentle touch over the lamp itself. Reclining rear seats will make two adults in the back feel lavishly accommodated. The boot is a respectable size with more than enough room for a small family luggage or the weekly grocery shopping.
