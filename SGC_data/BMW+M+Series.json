Having previously owned the BMW 335i with a N55 engine that was heavily modified and pumping out 370 bhp whp (dynoed) I was a little concerned about buying a car with the same engine and HP. Boy was I proven wrong. This car is a complete package. From M4 mecahnicals to trim line, handling and performance I am over the moon. It is an eye turner and fantastic M car. Theride is firm but enjoyable enough as a daily driver. It comfortably sits 4 adults and is a practical sports car.",

The engine note is glorious and in sport mode the crackling fro the exhaust thrilling. THe grip and cornering is superb with balance and poise. No nasty surprises. In comfort mode the car is refined and quiet yet ready to deliver gob smacking power.",
