The promotional package by C&C was excellent and was fortunate enough to be served by a very professional and patient salesperson in MB. I like the fact that there are electric/memory seats to provide convenience for regular passengers, the interior furnishing is sufficiently posh and well designed with much thoughts put in from driver's and passengers' perspective. Performance of car was decent enough but more importantly, it is smooth and doesn't cause any sudden jerks for passengers which makes it a comfortable ride at all times. Boot space is smaller than my previous japanese car but sufficient enough for a small family's usage. All in all, i did not regret buying this car!",

I found the Jaguar XF a bit heavier in handling. Very surprisingly the E200 was quite light for a big car. The interior is simply mind-blowing. Good power from the 4-cylinder inline M274 turbo-charged engineand the new 9G-Tronic transmission was smooth. Good turning radius for a big car. The E200 also comes with many standard features which was extra on the Jag. Finally booked the E200 after having my wife test drive it as well. Reliability... Well only time will tell, but the torque delivery through the power train should be more than adequate for SG roads. Checked on safety such as European NCAP crash-test rating and this car is 5-star rated and also a good US IIHS rating. Safety features include brake assist and Pre-Safe, though blind spot assist came with an extra $2.1K. The car comes with Eco, Comfort, Sport and Sports plus modes. Some downsides, the run-flat tyres do create some undercarriage noise on the highway, but no wind noise. Other than that the cabin was pretty quiet. The rims could have been more sporty looking. Overall this is one car that has swayed my decision towards Merc... Finally!.",

        "review": "ReviewMy review is with reference to the 318i M Sport that I also rented for a recent overseas trip. I had the C180 in Avantgarde trim for 6 days. It came with 9G tronic.\nFor whatever reason, the suspension was awful. It transmits everything on the road into the cabin, and has poor absorption of the bumps. The car does ok for low-speed bumps but it thumps uncomfortably on high-speed bumps. Road noise is also a big problem at speeds above 80km/h. The car was fitted with Bridgestone Turanza T001 run-flats and they are meant to be comfort tyres. Super noisy. The 318i M-Sport that i drove before the C180, came with 18\" Wheels and was quieter and more comfortable than the C180. Shocking. The 9G-Tronic gearbox wasn't smooth at all. It shifts hardly into gears quite often, unlike the smooth gearbox in the 318i.\nThe C-Class has an off-set steering wheel, and the seats were very uncomfortable for long drives, lacking in lumber and thigh support. Poor ride, poor handling, poor refinement... In comparison to the 318i M-Sport. And you thought those should be all the negatives? Nope. The cabin may be nice, with nice choices of materials for the switches. But the gloss black center stack scratches easily and feels absolutely cheap. There was a constant rattling near the driver's side A-pillars even though there was only 20,000km on the car. The 3-series felt better built with better fit-and-finish. The boot has a wider opening than the 3-series so it is easier to fit your luggage through the opening. \nThe C Class is supposed to be the most comfort-oriented car in the Compact Executive class, and it's premium pricing vs the rest raises expectations. I am putting this car right at the bottom of the class.",
