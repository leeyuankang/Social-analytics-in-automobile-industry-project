No 360 camera, no android auto or apple carplay. Indeed, sound of radio was horrible. Didn't enjoy the test drive either. Very noisy cvt engine. Although the seats look comfortable but they are not. Unfortunately, car looks like a box on wheels. Thanks to the reviews below and when I asked about solar film for windscreen the answer was a plain - \"Cannot apply\". Friend who owns a 4th generation forester advised against buying the 5th generation (current) forester and said has lots of problems and service standard is bad. LOL, I was witnessing it when I was there. Gave the salesman benefit of the doubt but he seemed very unenthusiastic. I was given a very low quote for my trade-in car and no discount for new car. Walked out of showroom and into Mazda. Day and night difference in service and enthusiasm. I got $9k more on my trade-in car at Mazda. Mazda CX-5 event car was going at 120k from 160k. Booked one immediately. Better offerings and package as compared to forester. CX-5 a much handsome car from in and outside - very conti. Much better price. Fantastic drive. Powerful 2.0L engine. Android auto and Apple carplay as standard. Bose sound system - it rocks! Lucky didn't buy forester would have regretted big time.",

Very unnerving as it felt all eyes were on me. However, none approached me until I started meddling with the car.\n\t\nCar seem ample big but the fittings are extremely poor. Front chrome grill seems as though it's made up of the cheapest plastics they could find. In the rear my daughter scratched her foot when she accidentally rubbed it against the plastic cover of the seat rail underneath the driver chair. Noticed the electric boot was a little finicky, not the best I've seen. Test drove the car and felt engine was underpowered. CVT droning sound was very obvious. Air-conditioner seemed very weak and lastly, extremely lousy lousy speakers. They should just do away with the (ugly orange) sports package offering and provide with a better sound system/speakers instead.\n\nCar's OMV is 17k and to sell it over 114k is so ridiculous. Although, the salesman lowered the price to 105k for the i-S variant but I think it's just too expensive especially, the way it is made with low quality fixtures and fittings. Only winning point depends on how you see it is the AWD but then again, in Singapore context not much of use with our smooth roads. Only thing AWD does is consume more fuel.\n\nAnother point I found out from the Salesman was that you are unable to apply solar-film on the windscreen due to the eyesight system that may malfunction and warranty may be void on eyesight because of this. I'd say folks, get ready to be barbequed under the Singapore sun!\n\nThere seemed to be more cons than pros for the forester and in the end, decided against buying one. Prospective buyers please look out for the above problems before parting with your money. Hypothetically speaking, let's say car was in total good shape without all the above (and below stated) problems I would at most, AT MOST part with not more than 100k on this car and not a cent more.",

Sturdy, solid build quality, with acceptable quality plastics and some soft-touch materials. An info screen on top of the dash shows geeky information like oil temperature, tilt angle and AWD grip. Main driver touch points like sporty 3 spoke leather-lined steering wheel and aluminium pedals are nice touches. \n\nRide \nThe car is the first Subaru on the new Subaru Global Platform (SGP). Front MacPherson Struts and rear Double Wishbones endow this car with a plushness not seen in cars with less sophisticated torsion beam rears common in this class. It tackles uneven surfaces with aplomb and refinement/noise is exemplary with the stock 17\" Enkei rims shod with Bridgestone Turanza T001 comfort biased tyres. \n\nHandling\nImpreza shines with its SAWD stability especially during heavy rain. Steering is well-weighted with good feedback. Traction gives confidence during cornering.\n\nPerformance \nNot a sports car or especially fast, but fast enough for most merging and overtaking manoeuvres. Coming from a 300+bhp manual performance car, I would say this car's performance is more than adequate for its class - the family bread & butter segment - a notch above 1.6NA or 1.0T cars and even on a par with lower powered 1.4T cars, without the low-end shove. The key to harnessing the power is mastery of the Lineartronic CVT gearbox. To extract maximum performance, one has to counterintuitively dab the throttle lightly, before more fully depressing the throttle. Once revs hit 4500rpm, the car picks up briskly. \n\nFC for my commute of 90% Rush-hour traffic in city conditions is ~10km/l. One can't beat the laws of physics at 1415kg with SAWD, but for those with a more forgiving commute, I hear from other owners 15km/l is possible. YMMV.\n\nConclusion\nUnderrated car which won the Japan Car of the Year 2016-17. Handles well, rides well and performs well. Safe, family ride and tremendous value for money.",

So performance wise should be the same. What is new on this car is memory seat, eye sight, upgrade console supporting car play. Some car mag also highlighted some CVT optimization, which I have no idea. \n\nPower wise, decent but definitely can't outrun a turbo charged hot-hatch. In sport mode, and a heavy right foot however, I can do overtaking with ease, thanks for the good handling. \n\nIt has permanent 4WD, so I can corner with high speed if I ignore the comfort level of the back-seat passengers. (normally, I will get an earful from Mrs if I do that). During one of the trips to the north, we encountered pouring rain. But the car performed very well. I could still drive at 80km/hr without worrying about aquaplaning. I think it must be the 4WD helping to plant the car on the ground. \n\nThe car is very roomy, and high ground clearance than normal sedan. It is comfortable to sit in. With high ground clearance also means I can drive through puddle of water where sedans have to park at the side and wait. \n\nIt comes with eye-sight, which packs with all the high tech features like lane departure warning, collision prevention, blind spot monitoring and adaptive cruising. They are useful but I can also turn them off if I want. Other features like electric tail gate and harman kardon speakers.",

The exterior styling was striking with strong lines and stance. The interior is typical Subaru and could use a little updating especially with the headunit that came without Apple CarPlay or Android Auto. \n\nSpace in the Outback is aplenty with a carnivorous boot, you will never run out of space. WIth the 2nd row seats folded down, you can easily fit a whole road or mountain bike in it with the wheels attached. There will still be space left over for many other things. \n\nThe 2.5L Boxer never failed to perform, chugging out torque when you need it. You could tell the difference between driving a 1.4L or 1.8L turbo engine vs a 2 or 2.5L engine. The CVT is smooth and linear giving a very comfortable drive behind the wheel. Sure the fuel consumption can't be compared to a smaller engine car but one should expect that when considering a Subaru. I averaged 450km per 40L of petrol with 50% Highway.\n\nThe AWD system like all subbies allow the Outback to be solidly planted to the road. I am always confident behind the wheel whether the road is dry or wet. \n\nIn summary, the Outback is a great family hauler with distinct Subaru characteristics.

For a 1.8m person I sit comfortably with plenty of head room and my back passenger still get loads of legroom. The boot is deep too as I managed to lug 2 large full extended luggage and 2 duffel bags without issues. Of course I had to remove top tonneau cover so I can stack them vertically but the cover can be easily kept at the under boot compartment so there's a lot of flexibility there.\n\nOn a fully loaded car, how competent is the drivetrain and power? Before I go further, I travelled from Tokyo up Wang an to southeast Chiba. I had a fair mixed of busy traffic, jams, slow layback town traffic and NS highway-like Wangan traffic. I'd say the 1.6 turbo engine is adequate under this conditions. The turbo lag is almost non-existence compared to my XT back home and there is no sign that the car is in any stress even that high speed. Wangan traffic is very fast and the car had no problem keep up with the 130-140kmh traffic at the overtaking lane. However you have to set your expectations correct. The 1.6 turbo version is not built to win drag races or overrun other sports-oriented cars, but it can keep up with SG traffic, esp. those high-torque Taxis. \n\nAs with the Forester, the Add to Lineartronic CVT is sure, tight and decisive. There is no rubberband effect like those 1st generation CVTs and the inclusion of paddle shifters made tackling the corners more exciting.\n\nDue to the low height and AWD setup, this car performs like a charm in the corners. The steering is a bit light and need some time to get used to but being an estate tourer, don't expect this car to tackle the bends like a sedan or hatchback.",

You will have to get used to driving in tight spaces and take care of the length during turns. Parking will also be a challenge and you need to be mindful of the rear. But of course if you are already looking at this car, I'd expect some skills & experience from you already.\n\nAnother issue I had is the FC. In my Japan trip, I drive mainly at smooth highway out chiba. slow traffic and city traffic accounts to 30% of my total driving trip. I'm getting 12.5 to 13 km/l max.(JDM levorg displays in KM/L) A far cry from the advertised 17km/l. If I've getting such FC in Japan, I think you have to minus at lest 2km/l in SG conditions. 10.5 to 11km/l will be an accurate representation. For a Direct-injected turbo I was expecting better FC. It could be due to my 70kg lugguage load or the fact that I'm force to consistently drive at at least 120km/h which is not an efficient FC speed.\n\nI also hear a faint whining some from the CVT at low speed if I mute my radio. The whining is not intrusive and sounded a bit like the whine you hear in buses, except that it much softer. I'm not sure if it's an issue but take note anyway.\n\nIn anycase, the Levorg met my expectations in my roadtrip and is a nice car to drive. I reckon the 135K price tag is abit too high but considering the high OMV it's not too bad of a deal.\n\nIf the Levorg had entered SG market much earlier, I might have considered it rather than the Forester XT.

Before deciding on this car, I test drove several others including the Teana 2.5, Peugeot 508, Optima, Camry, Accord, Mazda 6 and Sonata. Based on comfort, price and specs/features, it really was a no brainer for me. Fuel consumption is on par with the Accord, Camry, Sonata and Optima, but loses out a little to the Teana 2.5 and Mazda 6 2.0. Notwithstanding, it sweeps the 6 under the rug as far a comfort goes. In terms of exterior styling though, I think the 6 tops the list of cars I tried, but the back seat just didn't work for us. It felt far too tight for a car that size. Moreover, the wife said NO, the minute she sat it in it ;-). All in all, i think if you're looking for a family sedan, you really can't go too far wrong with any of the Japanese cars (honestly, even the Korean cars are pretty darn good).
