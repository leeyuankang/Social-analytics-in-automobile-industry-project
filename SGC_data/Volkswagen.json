For a family sedan, it ticks all he boxes if you want a big real estates.\n\n1.8 engine is pretty decent for Singapore roads.

Very sporty, reach to launch forward, and when you accelerate heard the engine growl. If you prefer quiet go for the 1.8 engine. If sporty sound than the 2 liter will suit you.",

Coupled with the GTI engine and  solid body, this mpv makes for a spirited drive. Sound proofing is excellent, just enough for families, not too slow like an mpv with torsion beam (XD). Great soft touch materials you would expect from vw grp cars. Super solid doors and great safety rating, unlike a japanese mpv with paper doors and poor safety rating!!",

The 350nm of torque also means that this huge car surges forward at the prod of the throttle, quickly reaching illegal speeds and beyond.\n\nThe new multi-media interface provides a bunch of customisations in addition to the built-in rear view camera view.
