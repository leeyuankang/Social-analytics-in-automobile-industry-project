I got the diesel variant so every full tank give roughly 1000km. Spacious at the back, so it has fair amount of leg room. Boot is big too! \n\nDefinitely a big upgrade to the Altis and Mazda 3 i was driving \n\nReally pretty car, many people turn their heads to have a 2nd look. I guess it is also not common, so it add to the uniqueness",

It\u2019S more stylish and upmarket than previous Zafiras.  After taking off the COE, the car cost that  I pay now and then, a diff of about $6k (include 2 year/40000km free service which I do not have previously), which I think is worrh.  As I do not try to speed up when lights turn green or always needs to overtake others, the engine performance for me is acceptable as well.The Zafira Tourer is enjoyable to drive, with well weighted steering and minimal body lean in corners.",
