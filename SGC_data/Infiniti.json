Immediately got interested and asked around for an SE to explain the main features of the car. Was really fascinated by the specifications and what the car can do. Was looking at the Highest Spec Model. When the SE clarified my doubts of the origin of the car, I was even more shocked and wowed. I have always had the perception that Japanese Brands could not rival Continental Car brands. Was pretty obvious that the Infiniti Q50 could match up to its conti rivals. This car gives the WOW factor and would definitely be a good buy. Probably a car that would steal stares from everyone.",

Would probably get the Other JAP Bros to move aside and let the more powerful brother cross.\nThis car has a really big boot space and good for shopping. Most sports sedans cant do this.\nLike the idea of Automated Seats.",

It\u2019s like some brands where have a household brand and a tuned and/or luxury sibling. \n\nInterior feels plush of luxury with the appropriate buttons placed appropriately within the driver reach. \n\nBoth sides electric seats with a good feel of luxury leather while others are pretty much normal where no sun or moon roof is part of the package. \n\nNo electric tailgate at all as well and no options like active dashboard display like you see in Audi or VW or Lexus.  And didn\u2019t try the console for its features if it had things like ambient lighting, enable/disable features and others where the similar competitors have in them. \n\nBeneath the hood still uses Mercedes that you see in the current C or E class series where you don\u2019t have to pay a high price tag to have a 3-point star engine. \n\nOther features like lane departure assist and so are in the higher variant of higher price top up too which baffles you back. Can\u2019t remember if it comes with rear aircon. \n\nThe drive.....Engine purrs up similar to a Jaguar XF as it quietly gets ready. Once you engaged to Drive, it\u2019s ready to go or dash at your pedal commands. The pickup is excellent with high torque, much tuned better than the E class which is the same engine. Paired with 7-speeds, the gear change is smooth with no stalls or hesitation but didn\u2019t get to try sports mode. \n\nTurning radius is easy too. Cruising is exceptionally smooth where as and when you need the power, just simply throttle on it you get it. \n\nOverall, it\u2019s a considerable car to get for its Mercedes engine beneath it if you do not mind some gadgets not there as standard or not even as options. Or the scaled price tag if you want them all.",

But a Lexus, this is not. \n\nLexus = old man luxury car, smooth, comfortable, not scary, quiet, underwhelming drive experience\n\nInfiniti = middle age man luxury car wannabe. Powerful engine, quick response, less comfort for more fun, more wind noise than a lexus so we don't fall asleep above 90km/h. \n\nthere is no perfect car, its always an engineering compromise between performance and comfort. This car is skewed towards performance over comfort, especially in sport mode with an extremely responsive throttle and aggressive gear change. Love the old school feel of the 7 speed gear box (reliable, 7G+ from merc) and lunge when the turbo kicks. 8 speed boxes (tried the volvo one) smoothes everything out until no feel. \n\nrear passengers complain of bumpy ride (after being spoilt in the back of the lexus which puts drivers to sleep together with the passengers since its so comfortable and un-engaging.)\n\nin short, lexus is great for passengers. Infiniti is great for drivers. Who is more important? Depends on how much backbone you have.",
