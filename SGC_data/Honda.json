Some butts are more sensitive to other butts. For me it is comfortable enough.

The rear seats are also very versatile. I managed to squeeze in bulky equipment and various big items when needed.\n\nThe rear suspension is really bumpy though, and it might make the rear passengers feel abused after a long car ride. Engine noise and the drone of the CVT gearbox can be intrusive at times, especially when you are starting off from a  stationary position. However, it is really economical to use on a daily basis. Averaged 15 km/l in 50/50 city/highway driving\n\nBuild quality feels solid but the piano black area surrounding the center console attracts a lot of dust and seems to get scratched easily.\n\nOtherwise, quite a good car to drive",

But this immediately dropped to mid 14km/L after the first servicing. \n\nThe drives within these initial two months have seen the FC finally dropping to 10.4km/L which is what my previous traded in Geely MK is.\n\nThis plus the loss of power is substantially noticable. Wherever i press the accelerator further to hit 3k RPM (yes i'm not revving type) the car have a noticable 'braking effect', followed by a sudden rise in acceleration.\n\nJapanese car can't be deem as quality nowadays too. Already at the 4,000 km into my drive i brought my Jazz in for i noticed there are loose knocking sound from the engine undercarriage during slow drives with humps in HDB carparks.\n\nTook my jazz in and is informed by the techniciain that:\n1. Under plate has come off,\n2. Engine mounting loose.\n\nWHAT?! FOR A 4,000km CAR?!\n\nThe problem even after they tightened the nuts came back the next day. Power also dramatically decreased over time and FC went for the dive, even with air-con off and tyres overly inflated as from factory.\n\nThe 19km/L and Japanese reliability promised cannot be trusted today. \n\nI will be taking my Jazz in again to the workshop for:\n- Same loose knocking sound,\n- Possible driveshaft issue as have knocking sound when pressing (slightly) and releasing gas\n- Poor FC\n- Poor acceleration\n- Non-responsive throttle and gearbox.\n\nI have a feeling did Kah Motors sold me a 2nd hand car for a new car? Have checked LTA doesn't seems like it.\n\nFor now i will treat using this car as a bad decision with a high FC, and probably high maintenance cost.\n\nAs for comfort, the headrest is not adjustable and the lumber just feels weird.",

So you could imagine a slow pick up then have to brake and stop again at almost every junction..\n- cannot connect to my MP3 player and play from the song list.\n- price - you are really paying a premium and betting on its reliability..You can get a decent 1.6L Korean sedan just by topping up a bit and it comes with much lots of fun features..\n\nSo it depends on your needs (and of cos, your Budget). If you just want a reliable point A to B car with perceived good reliability, and don't mind paying a premium, this is for you..\n\nHowever, also beware that With more 'fun' features in a car, it may also means that replacement cost would be high as these often comes with a price and give you headaches after the warranty period expires esp those electronics/electrical features..",

It is evident when I observed the interior, workmanship, and opening/closing of the door.\n\n[Driving Experience]\nAt 130bhp, it's pickup is impressive. On an angled slope, it does not roll back, unlike my Honda Fit. Drive is smooth, although the engine could be a tad noisy if I were to rev it up a bit. Not the quietest ride around, but the road noise is still acceptable. Fussy owners may wish to do soundproofing. I hope the CVT gearbox issues that was prevalent in Airwave and Fit is history. Suspension is not the best, but still bearable.\n\n[Front Seats]\nAs for front seats, the front passenger seat floor is slightly tilted up. For those who wish to stretch their legs all the way may find it slightly uncomfortable. No issues for driver as I find it quite comfortable. Generous headroom.\n\n[Rear Seats]\nSufficient headroom and legroom for rear passengers. Good space for elderly and small children to board. I noticed HRV/Vezel's wheel arch eats into the door space, and the ride is too high. Both resulted in difficult for elderly/kids to get in the car.\n\n[Boot]\nThere's a lot of boot space for a stroller, car seat (when not in use), and bags of groceries.

Everything else is great! The flexi seats, great fuel economy, switches, drive a Honda signature all there.  If u keep revs normal the cat and engine is matted well.  One of the better CVT.\nWhat if VS Toyota CHR? I will say they CHR styling is something that maybe only its mother will find is beautiful.

Undeniably, it is ultimately a honda and should be reliable. Conversely, the torsion beam suspension made for a bumpy and bouncy ride with poor sound insulation like a typical japanese van like a Hiace or Nv200. These japanese vans may not be the best in handling but they excel in load carrying. Should the odyssey carry full load, it will be struggling and gasping for more power for sure. Yes, even on Singapore roads. Trust me I'm not lying. Plus points for the odyssey is it has 3 specs, the cheapest for people for are unable to afford continental cars and take 7 year car loans :) With that said, i would much rather go for a Hiace since it at least has sufficient torque unlike this econobox from Honda. Since both these vans have poor safety ratings, i personally would not put my family in it.(just close the doors and you would know what i mean). All the cheap scratchy plastics found in the cabin makes it feel like a recycled car, even more so than a recycling bin.

The CRV does not benefit from fuel economy of a small engine because of its weight, Turbo Charging, etc.  In fact it consumes as much fuel as any modern 2.0L to 2.4L engine.\n\nBecause of the tiny engine, excessive noise can be heard from the struggling engine.  Road noise from tires extremely load.\n\nRide is uncomfortable and handling poor.\n\nHarrier has a better ride and comfort.",

Why? \n\n-The exterior design is clean and fuss-free unlike the ugly Toyota Sienta. \n-The interior design is well laid out and has a zen-like quality to it. It is more spacious than the Sienta inside as well. Honda always knows how to create a practical and spacious interior which its competitors just can't emulate.\n- The 1.5L Earth Dreams engine paired with the Electric Motor gives this car a very decent acceleration from standstill which can surprise other road users. Together with the dual clutch transmission, the whole driving experience is better than expected from a 1.5L Hybrid car. \n- Typical Honda build quality means a very well built and solid car which can outlast the COE.\n\nOnly complaint that it is everywhere now thanks to PHV scheme and the engine can feel slightly sluggish above 100km/h.",

During the test-drive of City, I realise how quiet the City SV was as compared to both the Jazz and the HR-V. The seats for both the front and back passengers were very comfortable and suitable for long range driving. Exterior wise, this is a very handsome looking car as compared to its peers like Vios.  Interior wise, the cabin is very spacious with adequate features. However, there is no apple carplay and sat nav in the infotainment system. Just the usual radio, Bluetooth connectivity for music and phone calls. Overall, this is a good all rounder A-B car.\n\nSo without a doubt, I booked the City and gotten it in mid September after 3 COE tries. Till now the ride is smooth and comfortable. The only thing I wish Honda can do better is to enlarge the width of the car and enhance the infotainment system.",

I have been getting about 22km/l on mainly highway driving and it is no where near the 32 km/l spec. What I do not like is the quality of the petrol engine and the way the petrol engine takes over on non hybrid drive.  Firstly it is a noisy and unrefined petrol engine. I am surprised as I previously owned a JDM accord and the engine was pretty quiet and smooth.  Secondly the way the petrol engine cuts in from the electric motor at Low gearing is also noisy and a bit too rough for my liking. At times you can even hear the metallic clicking during Low gear changes. The suspension is also pretty hard and there is too much body rattling while over slight uneven ground. I wonder if anyone has the same experience",
