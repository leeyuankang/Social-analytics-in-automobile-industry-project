Be it perception, stereotyping and brand association, this brand is NOT affiliated to me the least bit. However, all this changed after my test drive. Tivoli amazed me, in more ways than one. Safety, Quietness, Performance and Space, YES Spaciousness. After the test drive, the rest is history. Eagerly waiting for my ride to be ready.",
