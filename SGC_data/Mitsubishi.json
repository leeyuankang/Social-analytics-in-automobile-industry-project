Although onboard calculation for fuel consumption can go up to 17 or 18km/L but actual calculation is about 12km/l which is not too bad for a 2L car. Pickup is actually quite good if you understand the characteristics of CVT, but pls do not compare with more powerful cars. Sound insulation is not too bad but bulk of the noise comes from the undercarriage. Space wise is fine as the last row of seats are always taken by my kids. Can be a chore for adults.

They've improved alot of things such as adding air-conditioning towards the back seats and etc, really impressive. It really is a value for money SUV for a family, really good car! Yes, the last two seats might be squeezy, but actually the middle seats have a lot of leg room! I'm a 188cm guy, and when I seat in the middle seats, I have a lot of leg room! My knees are quite far from touching the driver's seat or the passenger's seat infront! If you push the middle seats a tad bit forward, the back seats would have much more leg room! This car is just so simple, yet its perfect in all the aspects of a budget SUV. However, I do feel that the engine should be a 2.4L, as it is a SUV. Unfortunately our government isn't very nice about that.",

        "review": "ReviewNo doubt, the Mitsubishi Outlander is a handsome looking car. Its Dynamic Shield makes its front looks aggressively sporty and isn't that one of the reason why people like SUVs?\n\nWhen I first bought the car, I love it mainly because how it looked and how it was being reasonably priced. However, after driving it for some time, there are some problems that I starts to see:\n1. The CVT is a drag and it is not doing the reasonably powered engine any justice. Overtaking cars needs tremendous effort from the engine and despite how much it roars, it just feels like the CVT isn't able to thrust the car forward. Accelerating when the car is already traveling over 60km/hr works better, since the car already has some momentum. But if I really want more thrust, switching the car to 4WD Lock will be needed.\n2. I believe that the engine reliability should be fine, since Mitsubishi is willing to give the engine a 10yrs warranty. However, I am not so sure about other parts of the car. Within 2yrs after driving the car, things started to fall apart. The weather seals on the doors and car body began to drop off, passenger overhead handle started to come off, just to name a couple. \n\nHowever, don't get me wrong, the Mitsubishi Outlander is not entirely bad. To be fair, besides the 2 key points above, the Outlander does have its positive points like, handsome good looks, good fuel efficiency, comfortable ride with good suspension, sufficient space to take 7pax at any time of the day, etc. \n\nAll in all, I would say that my experience with the Outlander isn't the worst, but it isn't the best either. In any case, it is still the better Japanese 7-Seater SUV than the other brand, which is also using CVT transmission for its comparatively smaller 7-Seater SUV.",

Prior to testing the attrage, make sure you didn't test drive any other cars else you will be underwhelmed by it. Any other cars will give you a better drive than this, even perodua axia drives better than this but if you can look beyond the shortcomings, its still one of the cheapest brand new sedan you can find in singapore. \n\n1.2 3cyl engine makes it sound like an airplane taking off from the runway when you give it a little push. If you are looking at this car, make sure you forget about everything you've ever known about driving a car, forget about overtaking on highways, forget about trying to be first at the traffic light, forget about noise-proofing. \n\nMajority of the people who purchased this car is mainly for the low cost and advertised low fuel consumption but some people forget that this car comes with a puny 1.2 litre engine and tries to drive it like a monster truck, then end up complaining about why the fuel efficiency is not as advertised. You will naturally want to floor the accelerator to pick up speed, to overtake as the engine is weak thus compromising on the fuel efficiency. \n\nDrive it like a tortoise by being super gentle with the accelerator and do not go above speeds of 100kmh on the highways as you will feel like you are bouncing off the roads and you might get a free trip to space as well. However, if you can look beyond the shortcomings, its a decent and value for money car in SG context with ample interior space for whatever purposes. \n\nThere is a reason why we no longer see many PHV attrage on the roads now as compared to the earlier years between 2016-2018 as the PHV drivers all complained that parts start to fail and broke easily due to their high mileage. Most should be scrapped now and unfortunately for those who bought the attrage in 2016-2018 are now stuck with this car as there is just no resale value for this car.\n\nWhat I also don't understand are people buying this car cause its cheap but end up spending additional $$ on mods such as adding bodykits/bars. With the total amount you are paying, better off just buying another decent sedan rather than trying to mod this puny 1.2l car into a racer wannabe.",

Given the high living costs, Attrage is just right for my wallet.\n\nCompetitive market pricing: 59k for the Modern variant now. Annual Depreciation at 5k+ is a wow!\n\nAftersales services: Purchase price came with service credits for me to buy plans to service the ride regularly. Bought the 2 year Diamond service plan for a start. A peace of mind on maintenance! Booking/amending service appointments is also a breeze too with the new C&C mobile app.\n\nDrive: Being light-weight at 940kg, it helps for a smoother ride with 1.2 engine. Power during cruising is brilliant, just abit sluggish when it comes to moving off from stationary. Not much of an issue here since our roads here are heavily used during peak hours and car speed is low. Helps keeping within roads' speed limit for safety is first.\n\nFuel efficiency: Pretty satisfied with the fc of the car. Able to cover up to 700km on a full tank! Being a light footer and driving in a mix of expressway & non-expressway roads, this definitely helps. Average of 18-20km/L for me.\n\nComfort: Rear space is big and comfortable. Still have plenty of leg room for passengers on the rear.\n\nFeatures: Many to name, my favourite being Cruise Control!\n\nLooks: Sporty sleek look with the sports kit for Style variant. Comes with shark fin antenna, rear boot lip spoiler, front and side skirting.\n\nParking is easy as Attrage is not big in dimensions. Great for tight spaces.\n\nA very value-for-money car!

        "review": "ReviewWent for a test drive of the vehicle and was pleasantly surprised by the space in the tiny package. This however also emphasized the spartan state of the interior. When they said it was fuss-free.. It really means it's not for the fussy. \n\nMoving off I had the biggest revelation. Being almost agricultural, the vibrations and idol and drone from the engine makes for a very un-enthusiastic and strained start. Almost felt like I was hurting the engine trying to push it over the speed hump. Maybe a tad bit of exaggeration there but it really is quite a stark contrast with a similar vehicle that I tried earlier that day. \n\nOn the upside, 6 airbags. Which is quite the assurance needed considering the vibe from the vehicle. Think it was hard not to reconsider the vehicle especially for those on a keen budget or looking to downsize. However can't help but look over at the Attrage at the showroom floor. Awkward boot aside, it has that added space for when needed.",
