Impressive though similar linings to the other sporty Porsche's. \n\nInside is simple yet reachable gadgets and buttons you have. Plus a poach of luxury sports coupe you can expect to see in a Porsche.\n\nTake off or pickup was excellent, drive was great in gear shifts, stability, cornering and handling.\n\nOnly thing is price unless you have a deep pockets to own and maintain it.\n\nOverall. It's a great piece of German engineering to have if you want a sporty drive.",
