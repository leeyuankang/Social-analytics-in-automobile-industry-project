        "review": "ReviewIf you are, like myself a person with low SES, read on.\n\nThis car looks dignified. Think modern exterior styling with LED daylight running lights and headlights. The interior is well designed for the limited space it has, and is well put together. In Japan. \n\nThere are no unnecessary rattles or squeals during operation, and there is little to complain about as far as ergonomics are concerned (apart from the rear seats not folding flat). This may be a bottom reefer car, but it is no Chevrolet Aveo, which is a great thing.\n\nPerformance is decent for a 1l engine, although the engine isn't efficient considering its displacement and the car's super-light weight. On paper, a Honda Vezel with a 1.5l engine and a significantly heavier body actually gets better fuel economy than this.\n\nSpace wise, you might be able to sit zero passengers comfortably at the back if the driver and front passenger are above 1.8m tall. Not a good thing if you have a family of adults to shuttle around often. However it's perfect if there's usually only 1 or 2 people sitting in the car. Or if you come from a family of dwarves.\n\nHandling wise, the car is decent, although doesn't seem to be as wonderful as what some reviewers make of it. Perhaps due to the stubby proportions of the car, it just cannot match up to the cornering ability of a low slung sporty sedan. We'll just have to accept that for the shape of this car, handling is as good as it gets.\n \nIn terms of safety, the car comes with 6 airbags. But that is of little reassurance when you realise that the car doors feel light and have a tin can feel to them. Indeed, the door panels are one of the thinnest out there. The sheet metal elsewhere is soft and the front grille is effortlessly malleable by hand.\n\nSo you shouldn't be buying this car just for its fuel economy. Nor the space. Nor the handling. So what is it good for? The answer is character. The car is relatively uncommon on our roads, is competent on the highway, and is well put together. It looks respectable from the outside too. \n\nIf you have to spend the next ten years in a low budget car, then this one has the necessary characteristics to keep you from constant self pity.",

When Champion Motors dropped the price for a short while, I decided to take a look at it.\nMaking an appointment for test drive was easy, and the sale rep was very friendly and extremely patient with my many questions.\nI have been driving my Vitara for more than a month and i am surprised that I am enjoying it more and more ! \nThe Vitara is an easy car to drive.  . The handling is easy, with a very responsive engine. I love it that the manual gear shift buttons are ergonomically designed to be on the steering wheel, making it very easy and quick for me to change to manual control of gears when i need. \nI cover great distance daily, and the very efficient fuel economy of 16 km/L on average , even when on urban driving, is what I am extremely pleased with.",

Manual gear shift control from steering wheel ! and the intuitive switch of the car from manual to auto gears , when I need to pay more attention to tricky traffic conditions.\n4. yes, even the look of the car. The Vitara does not look sleek and glamourous, but it is precisely because of its rugged and fun look that will turn heads.  it looks unique on the road among the all too common new-age, space-age looks.\n5. the back row seats are comfortable fpr 3 adults\n6. the analogue clock at the front.

It's not a fanciful car, but reliable and never once broke down.\nNaturally, Suzuki is one of the choices when I started looking. \nI have always liked the Vitara, but put off by the supposedly high FC. This latest version is inclined towards city driving so I have some expectations in its frugality.  It was the panoramic roof what pushed me to get the 4WD version despite the worse FC than 2WD, but it came with the Sports mode which makes driving more enjoyable and I liked that.\nSome add-ons from the dealer include front & rear camera and armrest which I got it installed 2 months after I collected the car.",
