For such small CC together with EAT6 Aisin GB, it's eager to rev and give punchy responses whenever the acceleration is depressed. The only down side is the noise level that this 3 cylinders engine produces. Haven't has chance to use the Sport mode yet as I'm more on city drive.\nAnother WOW factor is the iCockpit & luxurious feel interior finishes with ambient lights. A great disappointment is that our 12.3\" Instrument panel doesn't has the \"Driving\" Mode display which I been eyeing since day 1.\nRide comfort is good but a little bumpy and if strike a particularly vicious pothole it\u2019Ll still give you a hefty jolt.\nHill assist needs improvement as I encountered roll back on some occasions especially when Stop/Start function in activated",

It is clear winner in its class in most areas (exterior, interior, seats & performance).\n\nExterior - Look polished and elegant.\n\nInterior - Posh finishing and futuristic feel with its \"ICockPit\". Loaded with intuitive features e.G. Lane marking warning, adaptive cruising, blind spot warning, etc. Sporty steering wheel and gear handle.\n\nSeats - Comfortable 1st row (like other competitors). Spacious 3 x individual seats for 2nd row (unlike may others where middle seat is compromised). 3rd row is the game changer - acceptable leg room and width for anyone below 1.7m.\n\nPerformance - Despite the engine is only 1.6L, it is very efficient and powerful. It accelerates from 0-100km/h is less than 10s with 163bhp! It is more than enough to carry 7 x people. Very easy to handle with its electric and sporty steering wheel.",
