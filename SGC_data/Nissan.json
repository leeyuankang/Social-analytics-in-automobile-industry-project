Overall, a really comfortable and well-insulated car, though lacking a bit in features. However, fuel consumption is quite bad, i am a light-footer and average around 650km per tank. I also do not like the nissan-renault alliance, comprimises nissan's reliability as french cars are nortorious for breaking down and have expensive parts. The design of the car is quite attractive too, though this is another factor of french cars. So far, no issues/problems mechanically and i hope that lasts, would not want to fork a fortune on repairs. Only time will tell.",

Very comfortable.\n\nEngine performance- Acceleration from standstill is impressive, great amount of torque. \n\nDoors- Heavy, feel solid, increased safety.\n\nMetal roof rails- Can throw lots of barang barang on top.\n\nFew electronics- Less things that will break and less expensive to maintain.\n\nFactory-fitted leather upholstery- Seat comfort is one of the very best.\n\nSpare tyre - Spare tyre will always be better than those tyre repair kits. More protection too in a rear-end collision.\n\nBoot space- 430 litres with seats up, more than enough for barang barang.\n\n2.0 litre model has less issues/problems than 1.2, as seen from forums.\n\nN.A engine. Best for reliability. Turbos are more unreliable and more expensive to maintain.\n\nHigh ride Height- Better field of vision and high humps like the 1 at JB's woodlands checkpoint no longer hits my suspension, which tortured my previous car.\n\nHill start assist- Won't langa other people's car on inclines and i have about 3 seconds to look at other people.",

Not at all for us, should be replaced with a much needed safety feature such as AEB or BSM or something else like ventilated seats.\n\nMoonroof- Great for nights, not so when the sun is out. A pain to keep spotless as it is made of glass. Rarely opened, but honestly, i don't mind having it.\n\nStock Brakes produce a lot of brake dust- a huge pain to keep clean, already swallowed 15 bottles of sonax wheel cleaner, which ain't cheap.\n\nStock 19 inch alloy wheels- Look great, flashy. But Way too big for me, greatly affects fuel consumption and ride comfort badly. Normally used only on sport vehicles. Swapped to 17 inch.\n\nNO alarm???- Jesus christ, no thief would be stopped by just a immobiliser.\n\nLack of safety features- Only have ESP and ABS, whaaat? Come on...\n\nStock local headunit is quite bad- Poor Fm reception, laggy gps interface. Sound quality so-so. Would not mind paying a few extra grand for the original.\n\nLacklustre performance at high speeds- Trying to overtake at high speeds is difficult, rev high but speed hardly increases.\n\nCVT- Nissan's CVTs have a bad reliability reputation, as shown by scotty kilmer. Rubberband effect also squeezing me.\n\nNissan-french co-developed engine- Kiss goodbye to reliabilty when the french are involved and say hello to hefty repair bills. But the russians say it is a good motor, if it can survive russia, i think it will do fine.\n\nStock horn- Sounds like the ones on barbie jeeps played by children. Soft too. Safety affected, swapped with Hella ones.\n\nBody roll is evident even during minor turns but i can live with it.\n\nRain sensor- Seems lazy, sensitivity all over the place, sometimes wipers slow like turtle, sometimes faster than light, adjust sensitivity here and there but still cannot get the 'sweet spot'. Somewhat prefer manual ones.\n\n1.2 litre model has DRLs but 2.0 litre does not??? :/ Oh well, save more battery. :)",

Sales rep said this is how its supposed to work.. but gave me a bit of anxiety when approaching the next high hump..\n- The front blind spot is pretty bad.. difficult to gauge the kerbs in front at tight corners.\n- Air con at times automatically switches to \"fresh air\" even when it was put to internal circulation.. SR was probably right saying maybe it\u2019s a safety feature to ensure enough oxygen levels.. but not when there is a black smoke-spewing diesel lorry right in front of you ha ha.\n- Checked the real world fuel consumption.. looks pretty far from that stated in brochure\n- I personally don't like the feel of the car with the CVT.. does not give that \"kick-down\" feeling and acceleration with the auto gearbox like DSG or Aisin..\n- The \"thin looking\" 19 inch tyres makes the car look like it\u2019s on stilts from the rear.. I \n also read in some car forum pages that its difficult to source for 19 inch tyres of the 225 spec.. also more expensive compared to others..",

Decided to upgrade as family needed a larger ride. Initially wanted to get a Wish but decided against it as it had very few features and the styling looked very dated. Went for the 2.0 litre NA model as i will never ever buy a TC car in my life, turbos do not last and they require high maintenance. Recently went on a trip to Genting, car was extremely stable even at 160km/h, sound insulation was excellent too, barely a whisper. Car breezed up the mountain easily, 3000RPM was enough for even the steepest areas, unlike the yaris, which kind of struggled to get up the steep gradients, had to rev up to 4500RPM constantly. Fuel economy ain't that great, averaged about 10-12km/L, yet still acceptable as the car weighs like 2 tons. However, overtaking requires planning as the 2.0 engine feels lacklustre at high speeds, acceleration from stop is excellent though, really strong torque but peaks out around 100km/h, similar to a tesla but does not really bother me, i can live with it. Boot space is great, the leather seats are really comfortable, moonroof is kind of useless though, usable only at night as it's just too warm during the day. One feature i hate is the heated seats function, great for the UK or europe but obviously redundant here. Overall, still a great family car. Pricing is kind of steep though.",

Bought a used DIG-S model with a small 1.2L supercharged engine which can deliver 72kW of power, so driving up the steep slope of Benjamin Sheares Bridge poses no issue at all. Speeding and overtaking is effortless on expressways as the Note produces the power when needed.\n\nCornering is not so stable, maybe attributed to a smaller base and higher centre of gravity. ECO mode does save on petrol per fill but each time the engine restarts, the \"Shivering\" Can be felt. Also, I wonder if too many start/stop over the years will damage the starter component...After all, such electrical/mechanical parts do wear out more over time with increased usage and if the money from petrol saved justify the component replacement, if that were to happen (maybe a Nissan Rep can re-assure customers on this aspect).\n\nNissan scored many positive points with the Note.

Since the last servicing, the aircon just suddenly got warmer, tilll a point, it is just warm air on a hot day.  The dual climate control was clearly blowing much warmer air on the drivers' side. It was 20 degrees for the driver's side and 25 degrees on the left, yet, it felt cooler on the left.  I finally sent it for the 50k servicing, the diagnostics was that the cold gas was low and they top it up and perform few hours tests and found no leak.  To me, this is not an acceptable explanation. If there isn't a leak, why would the cold gas gone so low in just bearly 3 years.  I smell some BS by their mechanic here. My confidence on their maintenance falls greatly with the aircon issue.\n3) I am not a big fan of electronic controls for the seats, the good old manual levels are less luxurious but much more functional and practical.\n4) the infotainment system is llaggy and rather buggy. Through the servicing, i think they have updated the firmware as I have seen some bugs disappear after initial servicing. Occasionally, the bluetooth call controls are just screw up and the only way is to restart the unit.",

Must say pretty underpowered, only 3 people in car, floored the accelerator, though little vibration,the cvt is poorly calibrated and has  a lot of improvement to be done. The best cvt is subaru but their interiors are meh. Back to the x trail,the seats are very gimmicky but feels okay... Even the tiguan has better seats and much bettter ergonomics, obvioulsy poor in this car. Dont have any reason to go for this car unless you are a hardcore nissan fan??????Why??",

It is true that the GTR gives speed and this is what many people have come to love and enjoy. If you are looking for a performance standard car but cant seem to afford the Ferrari or Lamborghini range, this is the car to buy. Within the car, you get the speed comparable to a Ferrari GTC4LUSSO T with a relatively incredible exterior styling.  So much being said, I would not elaborate in the below",

Bought a used DIG-S model with a small 1.2L supercharged engine which can deliver 72kW of power, so driving up the steep slope of Benjamin Sheares Bridge poses no issue at all. Speeding and overtaking is effortless on expressways as the Note produces the power when needed.\n\nCornering is not so stable, maybe attributed to a smaller base and higher centre of gravity. ECO mode does save on petrol per fill but each time the engine restarts, the \"Shivering\" Can be felt. Also, I wonder if too many start/stop over the years will damage the starter component...After all, such electrical/mechanical parts do wear out more over time with increased usage and if the money from petrol saved justify the component replacement, if that were to happen (maybe a Nissan Rep can re-assure customers on this aspect).\n\nNissan scored many positive points with the Note. Overall, it is a good car to own/drive.",

Yet there is an extra piece at the nose that makes the hood looks longer than it is, more proportional to the car length.\n \nThe wheelbase is somewhat very long.. good for me, not so bumpy. It increases the turning radius to 5.2 (I think more like 5.5) from 4.4 of my previous drive, but it is ok, with the very-light steering wheel, I am still queen of u-turning.",
