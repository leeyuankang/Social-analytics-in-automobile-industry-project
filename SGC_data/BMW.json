However, the rear can resemble the previous generation F10 from a distance away due to the similarly shaped 'L' tail lights and silhouette. But overall BMW did a fantastic job updating the car's styling and giving it a very modern look. I found the F10 looking quite dated when next to the G30 on the road.\n\nThe car is extremely compliant over bumps and has just the right amount of firmness for a slightly sporty drive, yet it still manages to be comfortable.\nPower delivery from the 2L I4 engine is great, as the high torque figures help with acceleration and the engine is also very refined.\n\nGear changes are smooth and barely noticeable in automatic mode, the ZF 8 speed gearbox is fantastic.",

It does not seem as elegant as an E-Class' magnificent interior but everything feels plush, solid and upmarket although the only cheap plastics are found deep in the door bins.\n\nFrom the very comfortable driver's seat you can easily reach all the key controls and BMW's latest iDrive infotainment system really is the best in the business. It comes with satellite-navigation as standard and now sports a second digital display for the driver instead of old-fashioned dials.\n\nIt's quick and easy to navigate your way through its numerous menus using the knob on the centre console, and you can also use voice and gesture control features. The latter might be a bit gimmicky but overall the system itself is far easier to use than what you'll get in either an E-Class or A6.\n\nThere's loads of headroom in the front and enough seat adjustment for six-footers to get comfortable. Unfortunately, lumbar support for the driver and passenger will set you back \u00a3225, even on top-spec cars.\n\nSpace in the back is nearly as generous as in the front. Your passengers get a decent amount of headroom and plenty of knee and legroom - even for tall people. There's more shoulder room for carrying three abreast than you'll find in an E-Class but the BMW's rather hard, raised middle seat and huge lump in the floor mean the Mercedes will still be more comfortable with three in the back.\n\nAlthough it's a big car, the BMW 5 Series is easy to drive. You get a surprisingly good view out through its large windows",

Very good for short spurts of acceleration lasting 1 or 2 seconds. But past 4000 rpms, the acceleration tapers off quickly as the power limited engine gives up torque for rpm. From this point it is all downhill. The torque even lower than a 1.5L bread butter sedan, but dragging a 1.5ton body.\n\nShift up to the next gear and you lose even more acceleration. Better to accept to decreasing torque and shift up later. There is nothing you can do by now. If you're not done overtaking or accelerating by this point, it is better to give up. \n\nEven with the new dual clutch gearbox it still takes almost 12s to reach 100kph. \n\nIf you are a gentle driver that drives at low revs all the time, looking for a \"Branded\" Car with some practicality, this is the ideal car for you.

Of course back in the office amidst minted successful bachelors, I stood out as a sore thumb with such MPV heritage. Certainly even a cheap MX-5 was more useful in scoring a hot date than a 7 seater. And having \"Plenty of space backseat\" Was never a good pickup line.\n\nAfter buying the 2 series, I bust into office proclaiming \u201cI\u2019Ve just bought a BMW!\u201d \u2013 And imagined myself with Deal-with-it shades smoking a joint. Colleagues gawked wondering \u201cHow could a die-hard practical MPV fanatic succumb to an expensive brand that doesn't just bomb the bank, but has a dreadful maintenance fallout.\u201d \n\nWhen you look at the Active Tourer sideways, it was part hideous, part Touran-wannabe and resembled the new Kia Carens. Although an oddball and easily called ugly, the BMW logo turns it into Ron Jeremy rather than a typical fat guy that nobody wanted. Owning this felt like I had suddenly become Dwayne Johnson and could get away with sporting a fanny pack. Even my old MPV pickup line was no longer creepy. Those (hot dates) who were not really into cars didn\u2019T really care. It was still a BMW and I'd score.\n\nJealous co-workers swag posing by the coffee machine and the heartbroken MX-5 guy whose hot date dumped him for a handsome half-Thai with an old BMW Z4 start to voice out - \u201cAh here comes the guy with the fake BMW\u201d. True enough \u2013 This was a FWD BMW in Singapore and it feels nothing like the other BMWs in terms of driving dynamics. Nevertheless, the generous space from thin ergonomic seats, rear air-con, loads of features like the hands-free tailgate opening and BMW connected drive meant I lose none of the MPV practicality I enjoy which they don\u2019T. \n\nOverall, I could comfortably skip the \u201cRich boy\u201d Bird of paradise show and still fit amidst the glimmering bachelors in the company. Light on the wallet, big on practicality and perhaps comparable to a car with a \u201cDad bod\u201d, this BMW is a beautifully honest machine.

Many small pocket of storage space around the car such as door bin, arm rest, under the front seat chair\nPower & Handling - I drive mostly in Eco Pro mode.  Even in Eco Pro mode, you can get good acceleration if you press hard on the throttle. The low end torque of the car is good and accelerate from start is quick.  I haven't really use the sport mode yet as my car is still in run-in period.  Handling is sharp and stable.  Steering is a bit heavy but suits me well.  Brake has good response and stop the car quickly.\nFuel Consumption - in my normal route back & forth to office, I can get about 13-14 km/l.  The car has start/stop and in Eco Pro mode, coast when you lift the throttle.  It is amazing how far it can coast.",
