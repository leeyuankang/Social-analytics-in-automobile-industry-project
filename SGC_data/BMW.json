        "review": "ReviewBought the 2019 facelift edition, whose interior is so much better than the 2018 one. Looks much more upscale as compared to last year. More chrome, and interior lighting that's classy rather than striking. \n\nThe A4 beats everyone in its class when u compare its price. Significantly cheaper than the C class and 3 series, considering u get a 2.0T engine. Its fuel economy/power ratio hands down leaves the japanese counterparts in the dust too, like mazda, toyota. \n\nThe drive is very calm and composed, for a 2.0 turbocharged engine, cruising at 1200RPM constantly: explains the fuel efficiency. Sports mode is very toned down, only keeping RPM at 2000, which is very weird andl doesn't maximise the car's potential. Paddle shifters are a must to use, if you want to maximise the car's power. No worries though, as it can overtake any car in traffic in a breeze, without even hitting 3000rpm, with its 320NM powerband from 1200rpm to 4000rpm. \n\nThe A4 is very under-provided for, for an Audi. Horrific 16 inch rims, no memory seat for a family sedan, virtual cockpit is not stock. The audi drive select is completely fake, comfort mode is redundant, no adaptive dampers or air suspensions means they can't really improve ride comfort. Dynamic mode makes the steering artificially heavy, instead of responsive with high feedback.",

Traded in my 5 year old BMW 5 series for this and to be very honest, I was initially concerned with the space. I owned a Mini Cooper and 3 series before this. The Q2 of course cannot be compared to the cabin space of a 5 series. But I wanted something fun and zippy to drive. Something with power that looks great on the road and at the same time fun to drive without being a fuel guzzler. Reviewing this from my experience, I'd say the Q2 has the best of both worlds of both the trendiness of the Mini Cooper and the moderness and style of an Audi. It's simply the most fun car I've driven! Superb handling on the roads. Interior cabin is kept simple so if you're looking for something techy and elaborate then you might consider the highest end model. Fuel economy is one to beat. This week I drove 179km on just one bar (out of 8 bars) of petrol. Full tank about $90. \n\nLove the exterior daytime headlights as well as the interior mood lighting that allows you to play with lights (just like my old mini). Not to mention the fantastic sound system made by B&O. Fits 4 comfortably. 5 would be a squeeze. Good enough for me if you're mostly a solo driver like me. \n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a stylish yet fun car from a renowned brand that ticks all the right boxes and will not burn a huge hole in your pocket, the Q2 is the one for you.",

Must say it's Astonishing indeed. \n\nFirst looks is the impressive lights at the front and rear as well as the curves of its new design body, though you may have to look carefully to notice the curves. \n\nInside is a brand new interior compared to the previous generation where no more budge out ugly screens, making it look odd looking. Now is all totally flushed in console, making it a luxury feel in it. Great mind thoughts finally. \n\nThe gadgets are great to have in all like the virtual 360 degree revolving camera, enhanced virtual cockpit, full touch screen console with handwriting recognition capability, and much more to your astonishment. \n\nA pity that no variant comes with panaromic sunroof where you need to pay as option. \n\nThe drive is great as it comes with more power, less drag, 7 speed wet clutch gearbox (not the problematic dry clutch), more horses too. \n\nGearshifts are a Breeze and power delivery is certainly better than its predecessor, and in stoppages is not jerked at. Is a gradual stop with almost to no feel of it. Has heads up display too.\n\nPassenger at the back does experience a comfort feel as during my test drive, an Uncle followed too and too comfortable drive, even at dynamic mode, he almost fell asleep.\n\nOnly thing didn't ask if it comes with any park assist or so to try on. \n\nOverall, it's an improved A6 if you see it and for its drive, gadgets and best of all, its new refined interior with all nicely flushed in, thus giving it a high end luxury feeling.\n\nIt's kinda worth considering if you have a deep pocket of $240k (as of 9 September 2019).",

        "review": "ReviewGot my new car 26 December 2014 from Premium Auto. It's been three months, so far here are my findings;\n\n1. Having driven VW/Skoda cars before, in comparison, the Audi feels much better put together, quality materials, insulation, road presence and confidence it gives.\n2. Noise insulation is superb except for the tyre noise caused by the sports derivative tyres that came with the car. Perhaps it should be shod with Bridgestone Turanza series instead?\n3. After doing 2500km, the 1.4 TFSI starts to feel more lively. When new from the showroom, it was a bit lazy from take off but when at speed, especially if the rpm is from 1500, the take off for overtaking is noticeable.\n4. Noticed a lag below 1200 rpm or from stand still, there was a slight hesitation when you floor the pedal when you move off. In comparison to my previous Skoda Octavia 1.4 TFSI, the difference is stark (although I had a remap done which gave it 150 bhp and about 250nm of torque from 1750rpm). That skoda, you can feel the G-force pressing against you. In the A3, hardly noticeable. \n5. Fuel consumption is somewhat better than the Octavia. 12.5km/l mixed. Up to 18/19km/l on the highway, quite close to the published 20km/l.\n6. Features wise, it has all the bells and whistles that one can hope for, although a navigation system would have been welcomed, it's not very expansive nowadays. I'm not really into installing after market.\n7. Advice for those who wants to do a remap, all the ports have been sealed and breaking those seals would void warranty. I'd wait for the car to pass the warranty period before considering it.\n8. Space wise, it a lot more spacious now with the MQB platform and longer wheelbase compared to my MK 5 Octavia. \n\nAll in all I'm happy with the purchase and would recommend anyone who is considering it.",

Having made countless trips to the Ubi service centre, each time I left the car there for something to be fixed or replaced, I vowed not to return again to Audi. Perhaps not everyone can appreciate the reasoning, but there are always brand loyalists and good reasons for their existence. \n\nClearly, there are many alternatives within the SUV class and beyond. In the process, all continental SUVs were considered, as well as cars such as Skoda Superb. On the Japanese side, there was Lexus, Toyota, Honda and Mazda and their various models to choose from. \n\nPerhaps you have to watch the video 'What does it take for a car to be an Audi\" To know what I rnean. An Audi is just a bit more special than the rest in the same price range. Of all the 4WD available, quattro just seems most natural. The interior, virtual cockpit and the MMI exude class. \n\nSo why back to Audi? Perhaps it's the customer service. Perhaps the quality just stands out a bit more. Everything works well in symphony within the car. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this car to just anyone. But ultimately it was difficult to choose anything else to replace my previous Q5. And the clincher? A really good deal offered to me was too hard to resist. Cheers!",

Had also driven some Japanese cars. \n\nOwned this baby beemer for 3 years, clocked 100km, unmodded. Other than the normal servicing, there is no problem. Doors gave ratting sounds initially. \n\nWhen alone, this baby beemer provides drivers the usual bmw fun drive and stability. It is possible to do sharp turns at 60km/hr without drifting or losing control (not much body roll). At low mileage, when taking off at traffic light, this car feels slow and sluggish. After owning for a period of time, the car gets faster when moving off (at around 2000rpm), usually the first few cars, leaving the others behind. The steering is responsive, sharp and gives good feedback. All the above are driven in comfortable mode. Though most cars allow drivers to drive aggressively, not all cars are fun to drive. Driver seat is fairly comfortable but not the best in the same category. \n\nWhen with family, the car allows the driver to drive 'less fun', providing more comfort to passengers. The suspension absorbs well but not the best in small car category. Due to run flat, road noise are noticeable. The cabin is well isolated, however, when rev-ing with open windows, the rattling sound is noticeable. Breaking gives better control and less jerky than some of bmw competitors. The interior are more than sufficient for small families (inclusive of kids and elders). Able to put chicco nextfit child seat in rear seats with 2 more passengers in car (front passenger height ranges from 1.60+m to 1.70+m with sufficient legroom, knee not touching the glove compartment). The boot is adequate for small family. Had transported many DIY furniture's. Even though many sedans have 40:20:40 rear seats setup, this baby beemer has the additional height and height entrance for its boot. \n\nFuel consumptions are pretty good, ranging from 14+km/l (80 city drive-20 highway) to 18+km/l (80 highway-20 city; Based on Google map).

Colleagues gawked wondering \u201cHow could a die-hard practical MPV fanatic succumb to an expensive brand that doesn't just bomb the bank, but has a dreadful maintenance fallout.\u201d \n\nWhen you look at the Active Tourer sideways, it was part hideous, part Touran-wannabe and resembled the new Kia Carens.

Owning this felt like I had suddenly become Dwayne Johnson and could get away with sporting a fanny pack. Even my old MPV pickup line was no longer creepy. Those (hot dates) who were not really into cars didn\u2019T really care. It was still a BMW and I'd score.\n\nJealous co-workers swag posing by the coffee machine and the heartbroken MX-5 guy whose hot date dumped him for a handsome half-Thai with an old BMW Z4 start to voice out - \u201cAh here comes the guy with the fake BMW\u201d. True enough \u2013 This was a FWD BMW in Singapore and it feels nothing like the other BMWs in terms of driving dynamics.

        "review": "ReviewTest drove this when it first came to our shores sometime back but yet to launch at that time, where not able to write review here as its stated as pending launch or so until now. My bad.\n\nFirst looks from outside, is small WOW, large car with large exterior but not much changes to its curves and blends.\n\nInside of the interior, is a bigger WOW factor as interior posh has up-marketed from the posh BMW that you see usually.\n\nBoot space is indeed large and with full 7 seats, the 3rd row is pretty comfortable for an adult to sit in.\n\nThe tailgate is DUAL where flips top and also the bottom, perfect for back seat enjoyment and it has a feature button to lower the car when open the lower portion. \n\nBuilt on a new platform and design, the dated buttons here and there have radically changed and comes with multi touch screens where the conventional conti car turnable knob for headlights has changed to button controls too.\n\nThe drive off comes with a whopping 3.0L 300 plus BHP that steers you off instantly. Gear changes is a breeze for this 8 speeder and intense throttle you get the power you need anytime.\n\nComes with many features from active display, active driving assistance suite, surround sensors and many more.\n\nBottom line, if you have a stretchable budget of S$300k to spare and needed space, this is what you should get for its engaging drive (where others cannot seem to be able to test drive like the GLE or a heftier price like the Range Rover).",
